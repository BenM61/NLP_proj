Hold on is what they say
To get any back to you will have to pay
Don't shout or get upset
It's the same message from the holy Tory government
Don't rock the sinking ship
And don't fly in the face of it
Work for your heaven's way
It's the same bullshit from the pulpit and the president

Hear keys getting in my way
It drives me crazy when I hear them say
"Let us pray" 'cause I want my heaven here on earth

Get up is what we say
Don't wait for judgement day
There's too much going on
You might think you're weak
But together we can be so strong

This world is no man's land
Our lives are in our hands
Our will is our command
You put it together and together we can make a stand

Our faith is the key to it
The unifying for some reason to be
You will see if you stand outside
The big boss groove

Get on up!
Our faith is the key to it
The unifying for some reason to be
You will see if you stand outside
The big boss groove

Get up is what we say
And don't wait for judgement day
There's too much going on
You may think you're weak
But together we can be so strong

This world is no man's land
Our lives are in our hands
Our will is our command
You put it together and together we can make a stand

In our hands, our command, and together we can make a stand!
Yeah!
