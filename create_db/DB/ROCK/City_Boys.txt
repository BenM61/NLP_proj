City boys singing country songs
And they tell you what they've seen
City boys singing country songs
But they don't know what they mean
How can a boy from Philly tell ya
How it feels it feels to be in the arms 
Of an Oklahoma girl
And how can a New Yorker born and raised
Taste the taste of the popcorn
In an Indiana drive-in movie

City boys wearing western blue jeans
Walking down the streets
Snap down shirt
And cowboy boots
Just a shining on their feet
What good will blue jeans do ya 
If you ain't gonna roll around 
In the Mississippi mud awhile
And how will the boots come in that handy
If the dandy don't wanna walk across an Iowa cornfield
On a Sunday morning

City boys singing country songs
And they tell you what they've seen
City boys singing country songs
But they don't know what they mean
Now how can a boy from Philly tell ya
How it feels it feels to be in the arms 
Of an Oklahoma girl
And how can a New Yorker born and raised
Taste the taste of the popcorn
In an Indiana drive-in movie
