She says that love can turn friends into fools
Make ' em easy prey
Well I feel like bending her rules
I don't want to deceive her
Want to make her a believer
But she don't trust nobody
Who says he feels that way

Which of us is the fool baby
You can't win if you can't lose 
Which of us is the fool
Which of us is the fool
I would be hard-pushed to choose
Which of us is the fool

She knows her heart is so easy to break
She's so scared to fall
Can she tell how she makes my heart ache
I just want to hold her
But I know if i told her
She'd say I was just hurting myself
And it certainly feels that way

Which of us is the fool baby
You can't win if you can't lose 
Which of us is the fool
Which of us is the fool
We both fear lonely nights
Little girl can that be right

I just want to hold her
But I know if i told her
She'd say I was just hurting myself 
And it certainly feels that way

Which of us is the fool baby
You can't win if you can't lose 
Which of us is the fool
Which of us is the fool
We both fear lonely nights
Little girl can that be right

Which of us, which of us, which of us is the fool
Which of us is the fool
We both fear lonely nights 
Little girl does that seem right

Which of us is the fool baby
You can't win if you can't lose
Which of us is the fool 
Which of us is the fool baby
