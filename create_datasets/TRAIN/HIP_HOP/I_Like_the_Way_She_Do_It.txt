I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it

I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let her ass drop, like my '64

I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let her ass drop, like my '64

I'm supposed to blow, you supposed to know
Not to go against me or it?s R.I.P
I'm stupid rich, got retarded money
I'm special ed, I got special bread

It's easy now, please believe me now
I dismiss a hoe, bitch leave me now
I f*ck when I want, I do what I like
She want the same chick I want, the bitch is a dike

She a super freak, the freak of the week
I give her something to suck, she give her something to eat
It never enough, she like it rough
We keep it going and we switch positions, listen

I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it

I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let her ass drop, like my '64

I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let her ass drop, like my '64

I need a dollar every time that my heart beat
Now how much was that?
I can breathe on a track and make money
Hhh, hhh, now how much is that?

I'm getting money baby, my truck a Lamborghini
I'm in Ali be-be, where the girls are freaky
Haters wanna be me, hoes glad to see me
Ma, I love it when you lie and say my eyes are dreamy

Certain niggaz fall in love with a bitch
Patron in my dick, I f*ck the blood out a chick
I'm in the club frontin?, I'm in the club stuntin'
Ten grand buy the bar, Ma, it ain't nothing

If homegirl wit it, I'ma get it, hit it, split it
She'll think about me every day, hour, minute
Second to nobody, baby, check it
You look as good as a check

And when you're naked, I'm ready to f*ck, a little head in the truck
If her tongue getting good, I'ma let her come up
And when the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town
Stash box down with the mack in the pound

I'm with G-Unit, see-unit
Nigga you're not ballin? on a G2 jet
Everything you wanna ever do you need D
O-P-E, on a fucking CD, it?s me

I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it

She got a nigga on the countdown
Waitin? on it like, 3, 2, 1, yeah right now
You got skills in them high heels
When we leave this club, I'ma take you where I live

Do me before I get up
I might eat out tonight depending on how I feel
Baby girl got a thang for me
She do whatever I say and I ain't gotta make it rain money

Go get it then she ghetto with it
Told shawty, don't do it, but she already did it
I'm all on her back, when she move like that
You can find me wherever she at, like yeah!

I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let her ass drop, like my '64

I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let her ass drop, like my '64
