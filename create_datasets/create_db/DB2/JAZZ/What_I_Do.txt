I say Ray why do girls treat you nice that way
He said it's not what I know what I think or say
It's what I do
It's what I do
It's deep beneath the skin
It's what I major in
It's what I do

Yes I come to play and I bring big bad soul
Well I could rock long before they named it rock and roll
It's what I do
It's what I do
I'm specially qualified
To keep 'em satisfied
It's what I do

You turn the lamp down low
And make her feel secure
You've got to show the girl
That she's the one that you adore
If you want that sugar to pour

Well you bring some church but you leave no doubt
As to what kind of love you love to shout about
It's what I do
It's what I do
If you can't dance by now
The Raylettes will show you how
It's what I do

You turn the lamp down low
Make her feel secure
You've got to show the girl
She's the one that you adore
If you want that sugar to pour

He says Don don't despair, just take some time
You find your bad self You're gonna do just fine.
It's what I do
It's what I do
It's not some game I play
It's in my DNA
It's what I do
