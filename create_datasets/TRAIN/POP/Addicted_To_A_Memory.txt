We are, we are violent chemistry
Love has taken us as far as we
Can reach, but I can't leave
We are, we are imagine ecstasy
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory

Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory

Oh memory

We are, we are in love enemies
We are sentimental slaves on broken knees
We're on empty
We were, we were one identity
Now the trouble is remembering addicted to a memory
