Love is just a one-way street
If I'm lost without you
Love is not a two-way street
If I can't be glad I've found you
Love can't hold me tight on a sleepless night
On the strength of who you are
Love can't compensate for the fool I've been
To let it go this far
Love is when you put me back together
When I can't pick up the pieces
Love is the fix it man who'll do the best he can

Fix it, baby 
Baby, won't you
Fix it, baby 
Would you do that to me, boy
Fix it, baby 
Oh, I need your lovin'
Fix it, baby 

Just another face I left unnoticed in the crowd
To get my attention a Siddhartha bow
I can think and I can fast and I can wait
Baby, don't you hesitate

I'll make your third eye feel good
I'm your fix it man

Fix it, baby 
Baby, won't you
Fix it, baby 
Do it for me, boy
Fix it, baby 
Oh, I need your lovin'
Fix it, baby 

Said got your first eye into guys that feel the physical
What about your spirit, baby, is it cool
No, I didn't think so, ask me how I know
No light in your eyes aglow

For whatever ails you
I'm your fix it man

Fix it, baby
Baby, won't you
Fix it, baby 
Would you do that for me, child
Fix it, baby 
Oh, I need your lovin'
Fix it, baby 
Ho-oh

Just like Humpty Dumpty off the wall
I'm falling down
I am just the pieces of a fall
Don't you wanna fix it
Baby, wont you put me back together again
I'm in dire need of a fix it man

Fix it man
Put me back together again
Fix it man
Put me back together again

Fix it, fix it, fix it
Love motion in my mind
Take two aspirins and call me in the morning
Doctor feel so good

Fix it, baby 
Baby, won't you
Fix it, baby 
Do it for me, boy
Fix it, baby 
Ooh, I need your lovin'
Fix it, baby 
Ho-oh

Fix it, baby 
Won't you fix it, baby
Fix it, baby 
Oh, I need your lovin'
Fix it, baby 
I know you can
Fix it, baby 
Be my fix it man

Baby, on the serious side
My vibration it needs a little spirit
I can think, I can fast, I can wait
Baby, let me blow your mind

Let me blow your mind, let me blow your mind
Let me blow your mind 
Blow my mind, baby
Let me blow your mind, let me blow your mind
Let me blow your mind 
Ooh...ooh...and you're blowing my mind

Fix it, baby 
Baby, won't you
Fix it, baby 
Baby, won't you
Fix it, baby 
Baby, won't you
Fix it, baby 
Baby, won't you

Baby, baby, baby
Fix it

Blow my mind, baby
