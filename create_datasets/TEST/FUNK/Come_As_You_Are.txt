The weather's hot like hell
It sort of casts a spell
I want a friendly face
Inside a cool dark space

Yeah, summer's begun
This is where one, needs to be two 
Yeah I know I'm bold
But baby I'm sold on me with you

Come as you are
You can stand
Take my hand, I'll help
Come as you are
Don't be sad
Don't deny, yourself

So, are we good to go?
Don't act like you don't know
This is a brand new dress
Don't want to make no mess

Yeah, summer's begun
We can have fun, playing for kicks
Yeah habits to feed
And baby I need to get my fix

Come as you are
You can stand
Take my hand, I'll help
Come as you are
Don't be sad
Don't deny yourself

Come as you are
You can stand
Take my hand, I'll help
Come as you are
Don't be sad
Don't deny yourself

Got to give a shout out
Going to the people who feel 
What a sista like me is talking 'bout
Got to give a shout out
Going to the people who feel 
What a sista like me is talking 'bout

Hey, hey, hey!

Come as you are
Come on

Come as you are
You can stand
Take my hand, I'll help
Come as you are
Don't be sad
Don't deny yourself

Come as you are
You can stand
Take my hand, I'll help
Come as you are
Don't be sad
Don't deny yourself
