We are the desperate ones looking for the mark
We are the lonely ones left out here in the dark
We bought our tickets but we don't have a seat
And now we are just slaves to the beat
We are the tired ones tired of too much sleep
Tired of searching for the words we cant repeat
Don't mean to scare you but its getting too warm
I think I'm gonna move to the door

We are burning
This is real
We are on fire but we can not feel a thing
We where promised more than we can take
Everybody out the fire escape

Oh oh oh oh

Gather around my friends
Lets try not to pretend
There is a war between the cold out there and the fire with in
I know that were alive I know that we can die
Right into the thick of it

We are burning
This is real
We are on fire but we can not feel a thing
We where promised more than we can take
Everybody out the fire escape

I don't wanna fill my body
With drugs I cant even name
I'm tired of feeling the same
I wanna feel something

We are burning
This is real
We on fire don't you feel
We where made to be more than inches away

We are burning
This is real
We are on fire but we can not feel a thing
We where promised more than we can take
Everybody out the fire escape
