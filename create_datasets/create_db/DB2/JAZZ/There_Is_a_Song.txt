There is a song of peace, and we have found it
There is a flow of love, and we will sound it
An ancient friend is visiting our garden gate
His ever-newness wakes us from a dormant state

There is a light tonight, it draws the winged
Like moths we know the fire, we dance and sing it
Our hearts pure tears of joy are as a silent hope
To fly the way shown by a blessed phalarope

There is a song of thanks, we live within it
The way has always been, now we begin it
In harmony we see beyond the death of birth
In unity the Maker knows the made-of-earth
