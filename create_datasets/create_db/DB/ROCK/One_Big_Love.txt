Let's take a ride to the seaside 
We can go out swimming in the high tide
Just wear your shorts and your long hair 
Don't forget the lawn chair 
Everybody's gone to the movies 
Everybody's gone and its groovy
They went to the one about the big war 
I didn't, I'd seen it before

I guess I'm taking my chances 
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances 
Trading in my things 
For a couple wings a little white dove 
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love

Everybody do like a monkey 
If you want to go on and be funky 
No need to talk like a hero 
Talk a walk count down to zero
No sense defending your honor 
Just go on and kiss him if you want to 
Everything before is gone or, going somewhere

I guess I'm taking my chances 
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances 
Trading in my things for a couple wings on a 
Little white dove
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love

I don't know where we are 
And I don't care 
And now we're out of gas 
And riding on air 
And one big love, one big love, one big love, one big love

Let's take a ride to the seaside 
We can go out swimming in the high tide

Everybody's gone to the movies 
Everybody's gone and its groovy
Everybody do like a monkey 
If you want to go on and be funky 

No need to talk like a hero 
Talk a walk count down to zero
No sense defending your honor 
Just go on and kiss him if you want to
