I've been unhappy all my life,
Seems like all I do is sacrifice.
The more I sacrifice the worse it makes me feel.
Most of the things I thought were wrong 
Turned out to be for real.

I don't know if I'm ready
For the love you want to give.
I need something in my life to make me want to live.
I'm up in my whole life, 
But I think need a change.
I need some sunshine in my life, 
I can't stand the rain.

Tell me do, do, do I need you?
Tell me do, do, do I need you?

I don't need no man,
I already know the game.
I need more loving in my life
To chase away the pain.
You might be good to me, 
And I might be good to you.
I don't need nobody that can't be true.

Tell me do, do, do I need you?
Tell me do, do, do I need you?

Tell me do, do I need your kiss?
Do I need your love?
Do I need the pain 
That you might bring?
Like I said in my last song, 
Can't stand the rain'
Tell me do, do I need your love?
Tell me do, do I need your kiss?
Tell me do, do I need you?
Do I need the pain you might bring?
