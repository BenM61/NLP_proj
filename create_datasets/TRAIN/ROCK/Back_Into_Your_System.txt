I've been gone away, but I'm back again
Back with all my friends and I've been floating away on a silver cloud
Lined with all of my wildest dreams.
I'm back in your system now, and I've waited much too lone.
I'm back in your system now and I'm finally coming home.
I've been thinking of the days back when we began,
When we made our first stand.
And I get taken away on a silver cloud made of all of our wildest dreams.
I'm back in your system now, and I've waited much too long.
I'm back in your system now and I'm finally coming home.
I'm back into your system and there's a way to find
And there's a way to see and there's a way to get back in to your system.
There's a way to find and there's a way to find and there's a way to see
And there's a way to get back into your system.
And there's a way to find a way and there's a way to see
And there's a way to get back into your system.
Am I inside?
I'm back in your system now, and I've waited much too long.
I'm back in your system now and I'm finally coming home.
I'm back into your system and there's a way to find
And there's a way to see and there's a way to get back in to your system.
There's a way to find and there's a way to see and there's a way to get back into your system.
And there's a way to find a way and there's a way to see
And there's a way to get back into your system.
