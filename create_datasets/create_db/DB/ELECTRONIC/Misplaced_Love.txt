You noticed that I closed my eyes again
And smiled in all the silence I have grown in me for you-ou
But then, what accident of stars brought you so late into my are-arms
Where even now another sleep
Here in my heart I know that you and I are one

I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks o-o-on
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on at all our misplaced lo-ove
All our misplaced love

You noticed that I turned my head away-ay
And cried for all the goodness I could find deceiving you-ou
Ah well, how could we know the hand fate chose to be our guide was tired
Of lover's bliss and holding hands
And deep in my heart I know that you and I are one

I wonder if some joker sighs for what we've do-one
I wonder if some joker sighs for what we've do-one
I wonder if some joker sighs for what we've done with all our misplaced
All our misplaced lo-ove

I noticed that you touched my soul in time
And lied to stop my leaving
For a place where no one hears
But then what randomness and chance
Could move the mountain from our dreams
Or break the spell upon us now
And though deep in my heart I know you and I are one

I wonder if the joker dies what will become
I wonder if the joker dies what will become
I wonder if the joker dies what will become of all our misplaced love
All our misplaced love
All our misplaced (fade)
