This Craft, this beat, this rhyme, this vibe 
This style, they say music gives new life 
From a source inside that is forever flowin' 
This stage, this mic, this crowd, this show 
This life, I've been given a gift tonight 
And for that, I vow to be a vessel 

I didn't have to be, given the gift to rip 
I'll never master me, I know that it's from Him 
or Her or It, dimensions that sit 
Waitin' to sift through me, I fall short, still it hits me swift 
I didn't have to see, I coulda hit the lick 
I coulda drifted it quick, I coulda quit so quick 
It's really a trip, I guess I was picked 
I don't know what I did to deserve a ride like this (Damn!) 
I didn't have to eat, I coulda been so thin 
I didn't have to be, quoting these sentences 
I didn't have to reap, the work put in but then 
even the work in itself was such a blessin 
I didn't have to see, the planet lip to lip 
I didn't have to make, a livin' writ to writ 
I didn't have to dream and then begin to live it 
And for that, I vow to be a vessel

I give thanks for my rhymin' ability 
I don't front like it's not a responsibility 
I can open a mind, if the youth will listen to me 
I'm not goin' to front, like I'm on some killin' spree 
and as hard as the times are, God is livin' through beats 
that come not from minds, but that travel through spiritual reasons 
Some of the time, I feel like, it's not even me 
No mon-ey can buy gateways to infinity 
Still I'm hun-gry to shine, when I know I should let it be 
I want but I have, every single thing that we need 
So help me align self with soul and then I'll be free 
To sculpt and design verbal styles and experience freedom

"Let go, do what's in front of you" 
"Then, let go, then do what's in front of you" 

This ain't leisure, although it feels 
It is a duty, a way to live, another way to give 
Another way to just, have communion 
With the source of the sun and moon and, a way to pay the bills 
Displayin' skills, I take it REAL serious 
The vibe's so mysterious, not just one more day to kill 
..and I could lose my connection 
if I do not respect it enough, fffade away it will 
Day to day it gives energies 
That replenish me, if I believe and I say it will 
and act on it, 'cause action is the key to freedom 
Only way to be a leader, lead by the way you live
