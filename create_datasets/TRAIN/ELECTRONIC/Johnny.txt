I put my hand upon her knee
And she said - do you want to see?

I put my hand upon her brest
And she said - do you want to kiss?

Gently gently johnny
Gently johnny, my jingle
(repeat)
(repeat)

I put my hand upoon her thigh
And she said - would you like to try?

I put my hand upon her belly
And she said - do you want to feel me?

Gently gently gently johnny
Gently johnny my jingle
(repeat)
(repeat)

I put my hand upon her knee
And she said - do you want to see?

I put my hand upon her breast
And she said - do you want to kiss?

Gently gently gently johnny
Gently johnny my jingle
