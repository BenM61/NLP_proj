I like to feel like I feel
I like to do what I wanna do
I like to go where I go
'cause I feel it in my soul, yeah

Now, there's a friend of mine, friend of mine
He's doing down all the time, down all the time
So it makes me mad just to see him, mad to see him
But I wish you would free him like you did me

Free yourself, yes you can now
Free yourself, like I did
Free yourself, be a man, boy
Free yourself

Now take a look at me, look at me
You see I'm feeling iry, feeling iry
Let's go to...
And pulled it off the shell girl

And I'm not going back, going back
And debate, that's a fact, that's a fact
I'm going straight ahead, straight ahead
And I'm leaving 'till I'm dead, yeah

Free yourself, yes you can now
Free yourself, like I did
Free yourself, be a man, boy
Free yourself

Now get the feeling down, feeling down
Yes, take a look around, look around
If you don't like your style, like your style
Just change it with a smile, yeah

You see my point of view, point of view
It's such an easy thing to do, easy to do
Just believe in what you say, what you say
And take it all away, yeah

Free yourself, yes you can now
Free yourself, like I did
Free yourself, be a man, boy
Free yourself

huh, goodbye,

Free yourself, yes you can now
Free yourself, like I did
Free yourself, be a man, boy
Free yourself
