There are times
When I'm just a shell
When I do not feel anything for anyone
All I feel is hollow & bruised
Used up & mis-used
Forced to be soneone I don't
Want to be

Have I failed somehow or some way
Will the weight of today
Finally pull me down to drown
In the depths of despair
Where I am alone
Except for my rage?

My rage...My pain...
I hate... My darkest days
