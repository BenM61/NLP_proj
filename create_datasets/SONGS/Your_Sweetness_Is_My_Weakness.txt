Oh, girl, you know like I know, uh-huh 
What your lovin', girl, has done for me 
Like a Mona Lisa hangin' on a wall, uh-huh 

You're a lovely sight, lovely sight to see, mmm, hmm 
The way you give me your sweet love 
Any place and time when you look at me I get weak in my knees 
I'm so thankful that you're mine 

Your sweetness is my weakness, yeah 
Girl, your sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah 
Sweetness is my weakness, well 
You sweetness is my weakness 

They all say that I'm a fool, uh-huh 
For lovin' you, for lovin' you this way 
But sure as I am, I don't give a damn 
About what the people, what the people say 

Other girls try to imitate you 
With the other boys, uh-huh 
But I'm the only boy 'round here 
Whose got the real macoy 

Sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah 
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah (Uh-huh), yeah (Uh-huh) 
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah (Ooh), yeah (Ooh) 
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah 

Sweetness is my weakness
