I've got a woman as big as a house yes sir
She's as big as a two family house with a porch and a fence
You won't believe what you see when you look at her
She's enormous colossal tremendous gigantic immense

Why try to deny it
She's just what I like
If she goes on a diet
I'll go on strike

The bigger the figure the better I like her
The better I like her the better I feed her
The better I feed her the bigger the figure
The bigger the figure the more I can love

She's exactly like a watermelon
Big and round and sweet
In a party dress
She may be quite a mess
But I love her a lot
So what if she's not so neat

The bigger the figure the better I like her
The better I like her the better I feed her
The better I feed her the bigger the figure
The bigger the figure the more I can love

If she ever eats me out of money
And we need the rent
That'll be a cinch
'Cause when we're in a pinch
I can put her to work under a circus tent

The bigger the figure the better I like her
The better I like her the better I feed her
The better I feed her the bigger the figure
The bigger the figure the more I can love

She's exactly like a watermelon
Big and round and sweet
In a party dress
She may be quite a mess
But I love her a lot
So what if she's not so neat

The bigger the figure

The better I like her

The better I like her

The better I feed her

The better I feed her the bigger the figure
The bigger the figure the more I can love

The bigger the figure the better I like her
The better I like her the better I feed her
The better I feed her the bigger the figure
The bigger the figure the more I can love
