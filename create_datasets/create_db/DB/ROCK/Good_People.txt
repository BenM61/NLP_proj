Well you win, it's your show now
So what's it gonna be
'Cause people will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see
Before we lose touch of
We thought this was low
It's bad getting worse so

Where did all the good people go,
I've been changing channels
I don't see them
On the TV shows
Where did all the good people go,
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle of tat
Testing, one two
Man what you gonna do
Bad news, misused
Got too much to lose
Gimme some truth
Now whose side are we on
Whatever you say, turn on the boob tube
I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray, and by the way now

Where did all the good people go,
I've been changing channels I don't see them
On the TV shows
Where did all the good people go,
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting around feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all gonna be
You might notice some hesitation
It's important to you it's not important to me
But way down by the edge or your reason
Well it's beginning to show
And all I really want to know is

Where did all the good people go,
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the T.V. shows
Where did all the good people go,
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle of tat
Test down, one two
Man what you gonna do
Bad news, missed use
Gimme some truth
You got too much to lose
Now whose side are we on
But anyway, okay, whatever you say,
Wrong or resolute, I'm in the mood to obey
Station through station
Desensitizing the nation

Where did all the people go?

Going, going, gone
