Just one turn to steer your fate
Or wait for fate to spin you
Your trusting's fine but much too blind
Your compass is within you

These days pass you yearning
Like empty pages turning
You're holding out for something real, oh yeah

You can't play pretender
Because you still remember
Just how full your heart can feel

But how long the distance
Getting by and getting through
Your heart's strong insistence
Says that nothing else will do

But you could try on their distractions
And wear some empty compromise
But it's hard to breathe inside
Some cheap disguise

You can live your life completely
That true path, you're here to find
Or stay scared, leave your destiny behind
It's right now, here's the turning point in time

But just one thing can kill this dream
To compromise your vision
We find our truth or live some lie
It rides on this decision

Meanwhile those other voices
Hurry up and rush your choices
Try to second guess your fate, oh yeah

You can't wait forever
Gotta pull yourself together
Feel the time is running late

Well, this time right now
The turning point is here
So look deep, see clear
Soon your chance will disappear

Or you could drift into distraction
Wear that empty compromise
But it's hard to breathe inside
That cheap disguise

You can live your life completely
That true path, you're here to find
Or stay scared, leave your destiny behind
It's right now, here's the turning point in time
Here's the turning point in time
Here's the turning point in time
