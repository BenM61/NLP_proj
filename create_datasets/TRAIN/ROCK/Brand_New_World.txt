Mouths to feed, shoes to buy
Rent to pay, tears to dry
Brand new world, I can't relate
Let us choose to not participate

Now open up, let me wander in
Your heart is not such a tender thing
Brand new world, I contend
Only love will stop the withering

Oh, to lie in wait
As the shadows and the shapes
Spill across the walls
Like a river deep in spate

4 a.m., dark reality
Brand new world and my heart is missing
