Love you madly
Right or wrong
Sounds like a lyric of a song
But since it's so
I thought you oughta know
I love you, love you madly

Better fish are in the sea
Is not the theory for me
And that's for sure
Just like I said before
I love you, love you madly

If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly
You'd know the breath of spring
That makes me sing
My love song so loudly

Good things come to those who wait
So just relax and wait for fate
To let me see the day you'll say to me
I love you, love you madly

But since it's so
I thought you oughta know
I love you, madly

And that's for sure
Just like I said before
I love you, love you madly

If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly
You'd know the breath of spring
That makes me sing
My love song so loudly

To let me see the day you'll say to me
I love you madly

Love you madly

I love you madly
Oh, I got big eyes for you, baby
