On the street below these walls
Where I used to walk
Now I can barely crawl
All this darkness rising tall
Lord shine a light for me
I'm waiting to be called 

I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin 

Take this river to the sea
Where the Delta flows
The tide is washing over me
Guide this soul to Heaven's door
Show me where tomorrow lies
I'm waiting to be born 

I'm ready to lay down
I'm ready now to sleep
A promise I must keep
I'm ready to go home 

So tired I lay down
With these memories
Breathe shallow deep inside of me
If time has run its course with me
Then 

I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin 

When the evening shadows fall
When the time has come
I'll let defenses fall
To surrender's to survive
I will give up everything
To those I leave behind 

I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin 

I'm ready to lay down
I'm ready now to sleep
A promise I must keep
I'm ready to go home
Again
