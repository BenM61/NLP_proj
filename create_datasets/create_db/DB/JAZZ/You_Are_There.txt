You are there, in autumn gold or summer green,
You are there, to lend enchantment to the scene.
I hear music, and all because you are there.
In a mist, behind a window in the dawn,

We have kissed, but when I reached for you, you'd gone...
You come and you go, like April snow,
Until I wonder, darling, are you real, or an illusion I embrace
Half a dream, the other half that laughing face

Although, in my heart, I know that you are there
You are there, You are there!
