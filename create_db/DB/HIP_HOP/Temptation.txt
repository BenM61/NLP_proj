I know you see me watching you

I'm chillin at the spot and my posse's 4 deep
Had my man on my mind, turn my head what did I see
The fellas lookin fly and there was one that caught my eye
So I bit my lip switched my hips as I walked by saying
Sexy boy you're so fly, I just might give you a try
Ima write yo number in the palm of my hand
Oops I forgot I got a man

I know you see me watching you
And I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'

I'm thinkin to myself should I even take a chance
Should I do what's on my mind, or should I stay down with my man
This boy got me fienin and I'm wantin' him so bad
Should I chill one night with him and risk everything I've had
Saying sexy boy you so fly, I wish I could give you a try
But my man's at home waiting for me by the phone
Sorry can't get my groove on!
