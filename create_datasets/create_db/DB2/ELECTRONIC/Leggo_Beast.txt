Leggo beast lips of flattery eyes of lust
Leggo beast she says carnal love is a must
Leggo beast feet abide not a home
Leggo beast loves to play while her husband gone

I know a lady lady of easy virtue
I know a lady lady of easy virtue
Uptown living living is all she knew
And at her door step door step
Traps she would lay for you
To lead men lead men astray
Like a vulture vulture
Lurks its prey yeh yeh I say

A rose in her hair
The pretty clothes she wears
At the passers by she winks her eye
Fools take up the offer
They say stolen waters is sweet
She has no consideration no
That's why she lies and cheat

Leggo beast

In the twilight of the evening
The moon shines bright
Bread is pleasant when eaten in secret
Bosom of fire must resist it
This woman is flirting this woman deceiving
This woman misleading this woman is cheating
Choose to her content and fancy
Husband's gone she hanky pankies
Husband's gone
I know a lady lady of easy vinue
Uptown lay lady of easy virtue
Leggo, Leggo, Woman you cheat too much
Leggo beast me say fe stay at your yard
Leggo beast loves to play
Loves to play while her husband's gone
