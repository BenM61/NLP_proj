Outside the barracks
By the corner light
I always stand and wait for you at night
We will create a world for two
I'll wait for you, the whole night through
For you, lili Marleen
For you, lili Marleen

beugler tonight, don't play the call to arms
I want another evening with it's charms
Then we will say goodbye and pass
I'll always keep you in my heart
With me, lili Marleen
With me, lili Marleen

give me a rose to show how much you care
Tie to the stem a lock of golden hair
Surely tomorrow, you'll feel blue
But then will come a love that's new
For you, lili Marleen
For you, lili Marleen

when we are marching in the mud and cold
And when my pack seems more than I can hold
My love for you renews my might
I'm warm again, my pack is light
It's you, lili Marleen
It's you, lili Marleen

my love for you renews my might
I'm warm again, my pack is light
It's you, lili Marleen
It's you, lili Marleen
