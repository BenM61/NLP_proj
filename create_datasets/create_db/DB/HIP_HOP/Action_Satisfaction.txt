I see dead man grins 
Seven deadly sins 
Couldn't keep his mouth closed in the house of chins 
The all seeing eye that recognize the rap clones 
Plus possess the pin to crack the pyramid stone 
Its the call of the wild that's why my words rank high 
Drop the verse for nine planets 
That fell from the sky 
Do or die you and I get fly with rap expressions 
With the one two three four five 

In the session with the lesson 
Cause in bass and treble we trust 
With the rebels orally ready in case we bust 
And write a power chord and if the place be plush 
We kick the old school like Julio Iglesias 
Tapes we push be straps with no safety catch 
We attack like a bullet till your face relax 
And think about it 
If you ain't got the class to flee 
Be mentally ready for jurass-catastrophy 

Now its time for me to rise 
The lyric utilizer 
Down like fertilizer 
Quick to improvise 
A style that can surprise ya 
Your eyes is on the prize 
We can go line for line 
I ain't hard to find 
While we break your spine 
My mild style reclines 
I'm laid back 
All that talk you need to save that 
The payback is all the reason that I'm flexing 
The feds rocking like we X-Men 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
You say you want action satisfaction 
The brothers with the positive reaction 
The crew with style that's on top of the pile 
J5's gonna rock a long long while 

We get set 
Who's up next to pull to a fast one 
Lyrically connect the dots and then I blast one 
Now who wants action satisfaction 
Lyrics remind you of bass I'm everlasting 
Casting plagues my styles crossing the switchblades 
My momma shoulda named me Grace cause I'm amazingly 
Blazing with the fire and desire 
I'm world renowned I gets down to the wire 

If any child of mine gets out a line boastin'
My style of rhyme covers you like calamine lotion 
Lifted out like vine motion I spend time stroking 
You still drink a dime potion and dime boasting 
But now my rhymes open brims a spirituality 
We be giving power that you can share with your family 
Aerodynamically cutting through danger 
Ripping your narrow mentality nothing but flavor 

[Chorus:Repeat x2] 

The moral of my oral ammunition rendition 
Tuna fish on a Marc seven collision 
We be forever keeping niggas on they P's and Q's 
And the be's who snooze leave diseased and bruised 
I see through your crews like an x-ray tube 
And gamma rayed your function 
Left you with assumption 
That we be the butter clique 
We smothered with the action satisfaction that's guaranteed to be Jurassic 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
