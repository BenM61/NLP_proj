I'm walking down the road where the car yards end
There's bright flags waving in the air
But it don't seem like much of a party here
I don't think so

Whilst this man's selling Amway to all his friends
She's been chasing cosmic thrills
Is someone pulling faces from up above?
I don't think so

Maybe it's all in the way that we strive to be rich
It seems like every last one for themselves
Every last one for themselves

And we're just throwing it away
Oh well, we had something here
But you never know quite what you've got
Until the other mob comes and takes the whole machinery away

If you drive around this city for days on end
The streets all start to look the same
And reason is asleep in this big fat town
Well I think so

Maybe, we're falling asleep
Maybe, we've lost it, and we won't get it back
Maybe it's all in the way that we strive to be rich
You know it's every last one for themselves

And we're just throwing it away
Oh well we bad something here
But you never know quite whet you've got
Until the other mob comes and takes the whole machinery away
