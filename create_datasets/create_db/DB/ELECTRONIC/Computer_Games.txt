I fidget with the digit dots and cry an anxious tear
As the XU-1 connects the spot
But the matrix grid don't care
Get a message to my mother
What number would she be
There's a million angry citizens
Looking down their tubes at me

Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter, puter games
Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter-puter-puter, computer games

There's safety in numbers, they say
'Cause the figures never lie
No perfect persons ever noticed one computer die
I'm programmed to a schedule
What will the answer be
Is it suicide run till the work gets done
'Cause the matrix grid don't say

Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter, puter games
Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter-puter-puter, computer games

Jammed up tight by red traffic lights
Advance one level on green
These opportune commuters
They're blasting on their hooters
I fidget with the digit dots
Frustration rules out there
As the XU-1 connects the spot
But the matrix grid don't care

Com-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-puter-puter, puter games
