I don't know why I bring you around
When you you star tout so dry
And then decide to be quiet
Like an angry shout

When you consider yourself
And you do consider yourself
Well give me something that you like
If there's something you're so proud about

You're in love with someone
You're gonna love 'til it's done
You're in love with someone you don't like

You should have been a rich wife

Now tell me is your high horse
Getting a little hard to ride?
And your little bit on the side
Getting harder to find?

When you get restless at night
But it's too late to start
And there's nothing left to eat in this house but your heart

You should have been a rich wife

I don't know why I bring you around
Just to dis the art and look the part
But there's a bit you're leaving out
And you keep it all to yourself

But it's not the wine that brings a crowd
And the crowd is not much help
But you see the clouds and put your signal out
And then count the notches on your belt

You're in love with someone
You're gonna love 'til it's done
You're in love with someone you don't like

You should have been a rich wife
It was the good life
