I've done this one too many times now;
Wake to a face without a name,
Lying to close to the flame,
Oh-oh.

So tell me how I am so perfect, 
And how my voice puts you to sleep,
You're words don't...
They don't mean a thing.

Time to confess,
Will you forgive me?
I'm not as bad as you all think.

Time to confess,
Will you forgive me?
I'm not as bad as you all think,
As you think.

2! 3! 4!

Time to confess,
Will you forgive me? (bah-bah)
I'm not as bad as you all think,
As you think.

Who-who-who-who,
Who-who-who-who,
Who-who-who-who,
Who-who-who-who.
