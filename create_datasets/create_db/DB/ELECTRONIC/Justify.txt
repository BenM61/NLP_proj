At a time, in situations
When you want a thing more than you should
You would fall, you would crumble
By picking up the pieces from the storm

That was when you said you least expect it
That was when you asked, "How did we get this far?" So far
That was when I wanted to correct it
But I guess there's nothing wrong with being wrong at all

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat and do it all the same way
And I won't justify
One more time

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat every single word we said
And I won't justify
One more time

And it's fine to complicate it
Complicated's all I've ever known
I was there, did you see me?
Frozen in a flash, put on the wall

Now is when I guess I least expect it
But I will never ask, "How did we get this far?" My God
Even if I doubt for just a second
I can still find the right in being wrong, so wrong

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat and do it all the same way
And I won't justify
One more time

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat every single word we said
And I won't justify
One more time
