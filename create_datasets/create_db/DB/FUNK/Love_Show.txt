Skye
Love show

Sit down, give me your hand
I'm gonna tell you the future
I see you, living happily
With somebody who really suits ya
Someone like me

Stand still. 
Breath in
Are you listening?

You don't know
Somebody's aching. Keeping it all in
Somebody won't let go of his heart but the truth is
It's painless
Letting your love show

Break down. 
Give me some time
I don't want the fear to confuse ya
Right now, 
it's so wrong
But maybe it's all in the future with
Someone like you

Stand still. 
Breath in
Are you listening?

You don't know
Somebody's aching. 
Keeping it all in
Somebody won't let go of his heart but the truth is
It's painless
Letting your love show

Maybe truth, maybe lies
Made me want you
Maybe dumb, maybe wise
I don't know

Somebody's aching. 
Keeping it all in
Somebody won't let go of his heart but the truth is
It's painless
Letting your love show
You don't know
Somebody's hurting. 
Holding it all in
Somebody can't let go of his heart but the truth is
It's painless
Letting your love show

Love show
Letting your love show
