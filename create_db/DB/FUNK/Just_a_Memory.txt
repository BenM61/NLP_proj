Used to be the one I love
Used to be the one I put my trust
Now you're just a memory
Can't you see
Ain't nothing going on
With you and me

Time for me to say
Time for us to go our separate way
Everything we used to share
Came to an end
We're no longer lovers
We're no longer friends

I realize you were just telling me lies
And the pain you gave me I can not disguise
You gave me the world
And I was your fool
I cannot believe
All the things you put me through

Used to be the one I love
Used to be the one I put my trust
Now you're just a memory
Can't you see
Ain't nothing going on
With you and me

Time for you to go
Found a love to give me all I need and more
I'm moving on to better things
A better plan
Used to play me for a fool
But I won't be used again

I realize you were just telling me lies
And the pain you gave me I can not disguise
You gave me the world
And I was your fool
I cannot believe
All the things you put me through

Used to be the one I love
Used to be the one I put my trust
Now you're just a memory
Can't you see
Ain't nothing going on
With you and me

Everything we used to know
Everything we used to be
Just a memory

Everything we used to know
Everything we used to be
Just a memory, just a memory

Used to be the one I love
Used to be the one I put my trust
Now you're just a memory
Can't you see
Ain't nothing going on
With you and me
