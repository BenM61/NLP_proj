Too messed up I should have followed you
Where did you get that smile and that fine hair
I get my kicks from your walk in
I should have gone I should have been there

You come to take me away
Like a little white rabbit from yesterday
Little things said, said and done
I should have shot myself on the run

I wanna love, love, love
I wanna love, love, love right now
I wanna love, love, love
I wanna love, love, love right now
So come on

She's come back from the winter
Looking straight into my eyes
Now I'm standing like a lunatic
I bet you feel, I bet you taste good

You come to take me away 
Like a little white rabbit from yesterday
Little things said, said and done
I should have shot myself on the run

I wanna love, love, love
I wanna love, love, love right now
I wanna love, love, love
I wanna love, love, love right now
So come on
