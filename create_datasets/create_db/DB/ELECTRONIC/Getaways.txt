So I think it all started with a twitching ? all alone.
What you wanted to believe in. 
We grow apart in such an armored way every day.

Cause what you want is what you get
And what you get ain't happened yet

Hey you say you want out
You say you want everything
Take it while you can and then you run away.
You say you want out 
You say you take it every day 
Take it while you can and (hold it?)

I watch you stumble with your petulance
It's almost funny when it comes your way (through the day?)
Let's see your plan, your key, your getaways.
Watch you spin up on your cupid heals
How's it feel?

Cause what you want is what you get
And what you get ain't happened yet

Hey you say you want out
You say you want everything
Take it while you can and then you run away.
You say you want out 
You say you want everything
Baby won't you help me please understand
You say you want out 
you say you want everything
Baby won't you take it from my cold hands
You say you want out 
You say you want everything
Baby won't you take it from my cold hands

Ooh

Hey you say you want out
You say you want everything
Take it while you can and then you run away.
You say you want out 
You say you want everything
Baby won't you help please understand
You say you want out 
you say you want everything
Baby won't you take it from my cold hands
You say you want out 
You say you want everything
Baby won't you take it from my cold hands
