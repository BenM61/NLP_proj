I can't stand to live alone
With two children and a home
When Mother's Day comes along
They ask me where their mama's gone

Left me here scrubbin' floors
Never washed two dishes before
How can I tell two little boys
Your mama ain't comin' home no more

I've gotta find a mother for my children
Don't need no sister, don't need no brother
I've gotta find a mother for my children

We couldn't see eye to eye
Packed your bags, said goodbye
Didn't care if we loved or died
The kids they always ask me why

Left us on a rainy day
Begged her but she would not stay
Said she had to go away
Gotta find someone to take her place

I've gotta find a mother for my children
I don't need no sister, don't need no brother
I've gotta find a mother for my children

I've gotta find a mother for my children
I've gotta find a mother for my children
I don't need no sister, don't need no brother
I've gotta find, yeah, yeah, yeah, mother for my children

I got to and I got to, I got to find a mother for my children
Find a, gotta find a, gotta find a mother for my children
I don't need no brother
Gotta find a mother for my children

Find a, gotta find a, gotta find a mother for my children, yeah
Find a, gotta find a, gotta find a mother for my children
