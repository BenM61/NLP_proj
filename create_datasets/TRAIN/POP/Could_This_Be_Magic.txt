Could this be magic
My dear, my heart's all a glow
Could this be magic
Loving you so

Could this be magic
My dear, having your love
My prayers were answered
So far from above

I thought that it could be
Just a memory
To linger, my heart in pain
But to my surprise

I opened up my eyes
And I'm with you here in my arms again
Could this be magic
My dear, having your love

My prayers were answered
So far from above
Could this be magic
Have your love

If this is magic
Then magic is mine
I thought that it would be
Just a memory

To linger, my heart in pain
But to my surprise
I opened up my eyes
And I'm with you here in my arms again

Could this be magic
My dear having your love
If this is magic
Then magic is mine
Could this be magic
Then magic is mine
