I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her 

It's just no good anymore when you walk through the door 
To an empty room 
You go inside and set a table for one, it's no fun 
When you have to spend another day 
Without her 

We burst the pretty balloon took us to the moon 
It's such a beautiful thing 
But it's ended now 
And it sounds like a lie 
I said I'd rather die than live without her 

Love is a beautiful thing when it knows how to swing 
And it moves like a clock 
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part 
And it's breaking my heart 
To have to spend a day without her, 
Can't go on without her
