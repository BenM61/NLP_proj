You gotta count the cost
If you're gonna be a believer
You gotta know that the price
Is the one you can afford
You gotta count the cost
If you're gonna be a believer
You gotta go all the way
If you really love the Lord
He never said it would be easy
He never promised a free ride
There's a costly fee 
If you want to be on His side
Oh the Father knows the cost
His only Son was the price
And when He says to "Follow Me"
He's asking of a man His life
You gotta count the cost
If you're gonna be a believer
You gotta know that the price
Is the one you can afford
You gotta count the cost
If you're gonna be a believer
You gotta go all the way
If you really love the Lord
The modern day disciple
Still has a price to pay
There's a war within
And war with sin
And he fights it everyday
So be sure and understand
The voice you hear behind the call
You can't come with half a heart
Because He's asking for it all
You gotta count the cost
If you're gonna be a believer
You gotta know that the price
Is the one you can afford
You gotta count the cost
If you're gonna be a believer
You gotta go all the way
If you really love the Lord
