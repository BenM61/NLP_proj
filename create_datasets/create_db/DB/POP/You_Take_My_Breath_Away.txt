You
I don't know what to say
You take my breath away
You're every song I sing
You're the music that I play
And you take my breath away

You
You smile and it's okay
You take my breath away
Like water from a stream on a sizzling summer day
You take my breath away
There are words for the magic of a sunrise
Only none of them will due
For You
You take my breath away
And I don't know what to say
Cause you take my breath away

You
You take my breath away
And I don't know what to say
Cause you take my breath away
You take my breath away
You take my breath away
You take my breath away
You take my breath away
