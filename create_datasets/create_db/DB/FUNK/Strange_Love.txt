Strange love, I'm experiencing a strange love 
& all those funny funny things you do, ha ha ha ha ha! 
They only drive me closer & closer to you, mmm yeah 

Strange romance, they say I'll never ever ever ever have a chance 
But every time I close my eyes & try to realize it 
I find it harder & harder to do, mmm 

I wonder, I wonder if he ever thinks about me 
& if it's so, I wanna know 'cause 
Every day I love him & more 

Strange, strange affair, I keep hoping that someday, one day you'll care 
Enough to come into my arms so that I can give you 
All my, & all my, all my love, all my love, all my love, all my love 
All my love, oh I just wanna give you all my love 
...& fade
