Don't the moon look lonesome shinin' thru the trees?
Don't the moon look lonesome shinin' thru the trees?
Don't your arms look lonesome when your baby back's up  to leave?
Well I'm goin' up on the mountain  to call that baby of mine 
Said I'm goin' up on the mountain  to call that baby of mine 

But something tells me he's not coming back this time

Would like to go to the country can't take you
I'm goin' up  to the country can't take you
Nothin' up there a man like you could do

He's got fins like a fish
Sheep  like a frog

When he loves me I hallo oh, hot dog
Love that man better than I do myself
But I'm all alone, all alone on the shelf, on the shelf
