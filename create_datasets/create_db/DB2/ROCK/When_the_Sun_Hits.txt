Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me

My game, please don't leave me
Come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With the coffins under heaven
Hey hey lover, you're still burning
You're his song yeah (hey hey)

Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me

My game, don't lose me
Come so far don't lose me
It matters where you are

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With the coffins under heaven
Hey hey lover, you're still burning 
You're his song yeah (hey hey)

Sweet thing I watch you (burn away)
