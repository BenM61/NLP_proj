I don't really know what you're thinking
But I know what we're drinking
Let me put your night in drive
Cat walkin on the runway
But you belong on the highway
Calling home is only right
Yeah

Can't see nothing but blur lines
Hey, hey hey
Actin' like it's your first time
Hey, hey, hey
Girl I'm done with these games
And you need to get in my lane
Pushin' it to the red line
Hey, hey, hey

Girl you know that you want it
And you know where we're going
Girl you know where we're going
And you know that you want it
Girl, get in my life
Girl, get in my life
Girl, get in my
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fast life?
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fast life?

When I'm in the streets I'm speedin'
In the streets no reason
Lookin' in your eyes I see the signs
Put the start up, louder than a siren
Girl, give me some silence
Then go on another ride

Can't see nothing but blur lines
Hey, hey hey
Actin' like it's your first time
Hey, hey, hey
Girl I'm done with these games
And you need to get in my lane
Pushin' it to the red line
Hey, hey, hey

Girl you know that you want it
And you know where we're going
Girl you know where we're going
And you know that you want it
Girl, get in my life
Girl, get in my life
Girl, get in my
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fast life?
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fast life?

Life
Girl get in my life
Girl get in my life
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fast life?
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fast life?

Girl you know that you want it
And you know where we're going
Girl you know where we're going
And you know that you want it
Girl, get in my life
Girl, get in my life
Girl, get in my
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fast life?
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fast life?

Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fast life?
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fast life?
