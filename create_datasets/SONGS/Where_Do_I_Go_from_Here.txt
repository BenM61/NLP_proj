Autumn days lying on a bed of leaves
Watching clouds up through the trees
You said our love was more than time
But it's colder now
The trees are bare and the nights are long
Can't get warm since you've been gone
I can't stop singing sad songs

Where do I go from here
Tell me where do I go from here
You said you'd take me through the years
So where do I go from here

Lover's plans like fallen leaves on windy days
Flutter past and they fly away
I thought I knew you oh so well
And I need you now
I need to feel you in the night
I need your smile so warm and bright
I wish my mind could let you go

Where do I go from here
Tell me where do I go from here
You said you'd take me through the years
So where do I go from here

Where do I go from here
Tell me where do I go from here
You said you'd take me through the years
So where do I go from here
You said that you'd take me through the years
So where do I go from here
