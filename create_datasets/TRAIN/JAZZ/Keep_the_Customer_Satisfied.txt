I saw you standing there
Like you were waiting for me
I see you everywhere
So tell me what's your story
What I can I say
I've got points to score
Searchin' for notes
What can I play that you ain't heard before
Just to impress you
I aim to please
Got to address you
Playin' to your concerns and needs

And I say
If you don't like what you see on the menu
Then tell me, tell me what you want
If you don't like what you see, lets change the venue
Tell me what you need
We're simply switchin'
I'm the chef in the kitchen
And I know just what your thinkin'
I can give you what you're wishin'
Just tell me that you're sure
And I'll give you more and more and more

I keep my customer satisfied
Keep your customer satisfied

Have you been here before
I know it feels familiar
But it's a slight detour
You're dying from suspense but this won't kill ya
What can I do to get a second glance
Ain't nothin' new under the sun
You've got to feel it to dance
Don't hesitate to
And then let's connect the dots
I'll elevate you
Then let's take it up a notch

They say the customer's right
But I can guarantee
You think you know what you want
But I know what you need

And we only have one secret
We keep the customer satisfied

Sa
Tis
Fied
