Shoot me up, Shoot me down
It's a false society
Struggle hard, struggle free
Turn your back on everything
Something I could never see
Someone I could never be
So you take the best of everything and throw it all away

Set us up, set us free
Then take everything away
Social set, simple gain
The path you follow is the same
Something I could never see
Someone I could never be
And you take the best of everything and throw it all away

And I'm losing ground in this human race
And we're losing ground in this human race

Like staring at a blank screen
You're already dead

Tear it up, Tear it down
You're a tragedy to me
What you play, what you fake
It's not reality to me
Something I could never see
Someone I could never be
And you take the best of everything and throw it all away
