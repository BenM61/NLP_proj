Don't know what to say now 
Don't know where to start 
I don't know how to handle 
A complicated heart 
You tell me you are leaving 
But I just have to say 
Before you throw it all away 

[Chorus]
Even if you want to go alone 
I will be waiting when you're coming home 
If you need someone to ease the pain 
You can lean on me  my love will still remain 

Don't know what you're thinking 
To me it seems quite tough 
To hold a conversation 
When words are not enough 
So this is your decision 
And there's nothing I can do 
I can only say to you 

[Chorus]
