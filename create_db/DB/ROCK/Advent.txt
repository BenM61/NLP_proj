In the hour of darkness our worlds collide.
Assailed by a madness that has plagued our lives.
At the point of departure on the eve despair'
No recourse to reason seems to make any sense at all.

The light of hope shines in your eyes.
Dementia has gone, purged from inside.
Throughout our wanderings in a land of lies.
We fell from gods grace into a sea of storms.

In self renovation, celebration of love.
These both are virtues we seem to have left behind.
The light of hope shines in your eyes.
Dementia has gone purged from inside.

Lay down your heart. Induce the will of love.
To restore what little faith that you may have lost.
As morning brings rebirth a new day will dawn to ease our troubled minds.
Turn away on your side and dream of days to come.
