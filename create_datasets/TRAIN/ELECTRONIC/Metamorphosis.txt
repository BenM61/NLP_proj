midnite for mister mechanoid
yes indeed night-time is the right time
climb up out of the void
get what I need
don't remember choosing, only dream of losing
this protection, armoured shell
see your star from the dark of my gravity well
icy isolation, deep-space chill
if I don't spark now, then I never will

Come to me and I will give you rest

time sinking sand
gotta get inside her
make her understand
about the dried-up spider with the shaky hand
working the controls
I advance out of my black hole
to the very place where you keep your soul
have I got a chance, am I getting through
all I've got is empty space, an IOU
