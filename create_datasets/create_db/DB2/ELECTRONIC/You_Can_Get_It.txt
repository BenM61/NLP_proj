Oh I, I always call your name 
You're driving me insane
Baby don't let it end
Oh I, I wanna dry your tears 
There are so many fears again 
Baby don't let it end
Baby don't let it end

Oh you can get it
If you really try 
You can run,
But don't hide 
You can reach your heaven love
If you really fight 
You can get it
If you really want 
You can stop loving me 
Baby if you don't give up
You're my destiny 

Oh yeah   
Oh I wonder how I feel 
You make my dreams so real again 
Baby don't let it end
Oh I, I can't stop loving you 
See what love will do again 
Baby don't let it end
Baby don't let it end

Oh you can get it
If you really try 
You can run,
But don't hide 
You can reach your heaven love
If you really fight 
Oh you can get it
If you really want 
You can stop loving me 
Baby if you don't give up
You're my destiny 

Baby, don't let it end
Oh yeah
Don't stop loving me, yeah   

Oh you can get it
If you really try 
You can get it,
If you try 
If you really fight   
You can get it
If you really want 
You can stop loving me 
You're my destiny 
Oh yeah yeah
