The clock on the wall says twelve noon
Guess I'd better get up soon
The clock on the wall says twenty-to-one
And there's things to be done

Yeah, the clock on the wall keeps pushin' me
That's not the way I want my life to be
If you take any pushin' from that clock on the wall
You won't be happy at all

The clock on the wall says a quarter-to-three
I got people to see
Meet my friend Clive, start drinkin' by five
End up wishin' I weren't alive

I look at the clock, it says twenty-to-nine
I gotta meet my girl on time
She puts me down and then, by twenty-to-ten
I'm out drinkin' again

Yeah, the clock on the wall keeps pushin' me
That's not the way I want my life to be
If you take any pushin' from that clock on the wall
You won't be happy at all

The clock on the wall strikes the midnight hour
I'm feelin' dirty and sour
I feel the clock pushin' like the blade of a knife
I wanna end my life

But it ain't no use, I'm used to this abuse
This is my moment of truth
Life is empty, my friends are all gone
But like the clock on the wall, I'll go on and on and on

The clock on the wall keeps pushin' me
That's not the way I want my life to be
If you take any pushin' from that clock on the wall
You won't be happy at all

It's watchin' me every day, the hours and minutes tick away
I'm not gettin' any younger, it keeps on and on and on
I can't stand it, it never stops for anything
The clock just keeps moving, ticking
My life is going, the clock is moving
