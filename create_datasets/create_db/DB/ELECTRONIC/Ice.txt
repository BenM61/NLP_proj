My mouth is frozen so I can't even speak
What a disappointment, I had it perfectly
What I was going to bring up suddenly
Stood like a stone as you stood quietly
You're making it hard for me
All I can do is freeze

What I mean is, all I need is,
Just a little emotion
'Cause all I see is you not feeling
And you're giving me nothing nice
I tried to do you right, why'd you have to go and turn to ice
(Ice)

I don't think you're knowing how hard this is for me
I'm not the type to say sorry constantly
So I swallowed my pride and I got on my knee
But still you just stood there as you stared at me
Your ego is getting old
How did you get so cold

What I mean is, all I need is,
Just a little emotion
'Cause all I see is you not feeling
And you're giving me nothing nice
I tried to do you right, why'd you have to go and turn to ice
(Ice)

I'm looking at you looking at me, what can I do but say sorry
It's a little late but you know I just want you to be happy.
What I got to say to make you let me get away with it this time.
I know you're upset and that you're happy just to sit and hate me,
But I'll make a bet that you'll be better to forget about me,
Even better yet I'll let a little light melt the ice, ice baby!

My mouth is frozen so I can't even speak
I'm not the type to say sorry constantly

What I mean is, all I need is,
Just a little emotion
'Cause all I see is you not feeling
And you're giving me nothing
What I mean is, all I need is,
Just a little emotion
'Cause all I see is you not feeling
And you're giving me nothing nice
I tried to do you right, why'd you have to go
I tried to do you right, why'd you have to go and turn to ice
