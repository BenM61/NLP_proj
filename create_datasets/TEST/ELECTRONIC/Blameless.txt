Souvenirs of pain,nonphysical
Colour me again, Ms.Miserable
Voodoo that you do
Weaponized
Not until you're through
Have I realized
I've only got myself to blame
In name
Well there's plenty of blame to go around
You cast my name into the ground
Poison me, with rumours that you pass on...
It's plain to see
The hate we share in common
Pouring again
Word begin to turn
I'm gasoline
It's your time to burn
My vengeance stokes the flame
It's a shame
There's plenty of shame to go around
I burnt your ego to the ground
Hooray for me...
You go back to Manchester
I will stay in the hills
Now you're the shining hero
Calling me a shrew
I'm given cause to wonder
Can vengeance lead to murder?
You would be so naked 
Without your golden crown
Accusations, burn through my brain
Exposing you
Am I really to blame?
Blame?
Blame?
Blame?
Blame?
Blame?
