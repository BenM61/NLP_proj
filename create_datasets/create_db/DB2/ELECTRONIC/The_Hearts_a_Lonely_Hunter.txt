The truth is unspoken, a promise is broken
I'm under surveillance, they know what my name is
I need some protection, some love and affection
There's a thousand reasons, but one is the number

Welcome to my spaceship
It's beautiful forever
She's right here where you left her
And the heart's lonely hunter

Save bottles of water and flour and sugar
Turn off the AC and hang up the bed sheets
Cover up windows, careful where the light goes
Yank out the cable and blow out the candle

Welcome to my spaceship
You're beautiful forever
She's right here where you left her
And the heart's lonely hunter

Perfectly molded almost unfolded
Under the counter well, that is your nature
Drip grind or roasted, buttered or toasted
The greater the DB's the higher the AC

Psycho acoustics
Down in the black seats
Stereo nation
Amplification
The brave and the righteous
They're safe in their houses
Now one is just a number
The heart's a lonely hunter
One is the number
Heart is a hunter
One is a number
Heart is a hunter

Welcome to my spaceship
You're beautiful forever
She's right here where you left her
And the heart's lonely hunter

Welcome to my spaceship
You're beautiful forever
She's right here where you left her
And the heart's lonely hunter
