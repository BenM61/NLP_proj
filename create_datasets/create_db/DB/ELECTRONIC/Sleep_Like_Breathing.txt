Every word's so
Every word's so fragile

Inside passion that feels like chasing rain
When the slowness of the day is gone

Leaving shadow-like feelings to depend upon
Every word's so
Every word's so fragile

Inside passion that feels like chasing rain
You sleep like breathing
You sleep like breath - gently

And the tease cries weeping listless laughter
Always thirsty like an attractive flower
When the danger in the touch is gone

Changing delicate evenings to reflecting ones
And the tease cries weeping listless laughter

Always thirsty like an attractive flower
You sleep like breathing
You sleep like breath - gently

You sleep like breathing
You sleep like breath

You sleep like breathing
You sleep like breath

You sleep like breathing
