[R. Kelly]
I want to see you move your body like a snake yeah
Eh yo can y'all hear me out there alright, now this is what I want to see
I want to see all of the ladies line up right here now

[Chorus]
Move your body like a snake ma, like that,
Shake it 'til it want to break ma , like that,
Don't hold back let it go na' , like that,
Let your money make a jump na', like that,
Let me see ya go aron' na, like that,
Bring it up and let it roll na' like that,
I love the way you work your chocha, like that,
You make me want to get to know ya, like that.

Lovin' the way you move so sexy
Mama you're bringin' me to my knees
Hands in the air like you came to party 
Shakin' that ass makin' the whole club freeze

Body smokin' like a Cuban cigar

Of all sorts some of y'all want to be players and ballers in all courts
Ok lets play rob scooped me up form midway in a Bentley now bubble in the club with wild women that's orderin' beers here's

And from the beginnin' wanted to taste your venom
