I got a woman with plenty of money
She got the money and I got the honey
Called my baby late last night
She told me daddy everything was all right

She got the money and I got the honey
She got the money and I got the honey
She got the money and I got the honey

I don't have to worry about her she's real fine
I know my baby and she's all mine
She give me a Cadillac, a diamond ring
She told me daddy don't you worry bout a thing

She got the money and I got the honey
She got the money and I got the honey
She got the money and I got the honey

She's all mine and I'm so glad
She's the best woman that I ever had
She's all mine and I'm so glad
She's all mine and I'm so glad
She's all mine and I'm so glad

Ah, stop your train
Ah mama stop your train
