Eyes lit
I want short breaths
I found dark eye lids
Nice breasts
Like the summer into rough hands

Eyes lit
I want short breaths
I found dark eyelids
Nice breasts
Like the summer into rough hands

Eyes lit
I want short breaths
I found dark eyelids
Nice breasts
Like the summer into rough hands

Eyes lit
I want short breaths
I found dark eye lids
Nice breasts
Like the summer into rough hands

Eyes lit
I want short breaths
I found dark eye lids
Nice breasts
Like the summer into rough hands

Eyes lit
I want short breaths
I found dark eye lids
Nice breasts
Like the summer into rough hands

Eyes lit
I want short breaths
I found dark eye lids
Nice breasts
Like the summer into rough hands

Eyes lit
I want short breaths
I found dark eye lids
Nice breasts
Like the summer into rough hands

Eyes lit
I want short breaths
I found dark eye lids
Nice breasts
Like the summer into rough hands

Eyes lit
On short breaths
From dark lids
Firm nice breasts
Up the summer into rough hands
