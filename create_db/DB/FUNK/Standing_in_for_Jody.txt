I don't need nobody
Shaking my tree
Save all your love
Save it just for me

You kiss me but the feeling just ain't there
No, no you're saving the real thing for Jody
And you're using me just for a spare
I can see through that

You come running, running
Running, running, running to me
Each time Jody makes you cry
Lord, have mercy

You're nothing but a fool for Jody
But I'm a bigger fool to watch the
Tears as they fall from your eyes
All right, now

I'm gonna tell you something
I'm tired of standing in for Jody
(I got to keep you for myself)
Oh, tired of standing in for Jody
(I got to keep you for myself)
You see, a man can't be a man
Playing second fiddle to someone else

One day, one day soon, baby
You're gonna wake up and see
Jody's just using you, baby
The same doggone ways
Using [Incomprehensible]

But let me tell you something
I'm so tired, I've had enough
'Cause you're callin' out his name
When we're making love

Each day, I love you a little bit more
How do you think I feel
When Jody comes around
And I have to go

I don't want nobody
Shaking apples in my tree
Save all your love
Give it all to me
Oh, yeah, now

Stop using me
Using me, using me
Lord, have mercy

Tired of standing in for Jody
(I got to keep you for myself)
Oh, I'm so tired of standing in for Jody
(I got to keep you for myself)
A man can't be a man playing
Second fiddle to someone else

I bet somebody's waiting out there tonight
Watching their watch trying to see what time it is
Jody was supposed to pick you up take you to the movie show
Then he called, he told you it's too late
I got another date, honey can't see you no more

Don't you get tired
Of waiting on Jody
(Standing in on Jody)
Don't you get tired
Standing in, standing in
And waiting for

Tired, tired, tired
Oh, I'm so tired
Jody [Incomprehensible]
