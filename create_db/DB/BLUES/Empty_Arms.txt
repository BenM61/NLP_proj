You're gonna miss me little baby the day that I'm gone 
You're gonna miss me little darlin the day that I'm gone 
Cause I'm leavin in the mornin, won't be back at all 

You have run me ragged baby, It's your own fault you're on your own 
You have run me ragged darlin, It's your own fault you're on your own 
You didn't want me no way baby, till your other man was gone 

You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms 
You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms 
But when all your games are over, you'll be left with empty arms

You have run me ragged baby, It's your own fault you're on your own 
You have run me ragged darlin, It's your own fault you're on your own 
You didn't want me no way baby, till your other man was gone 

You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms 
You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms 
But when all your games are over, you'll be left with empty arms
