I got love for the game that's why I'm rhyming always stay in the booth
Never lying to the people always telling the truth
I feel the bass in my chest give power to songs
Girl ripping when I'm home about the hours I'm gone
I can't help it the studio where Paul be at
Tried to walk away from it but it called me back
Forget my pride shit I even quit my job
For the one that I love to work music
Recognized by my art that I spill in my game
Pour my heart on the track and have you feeling my pain
Seen a lot of hard times on the way to success
When I'm mad writing a rhyme is my way to express
Lay back and fall deep in a verse
If I was out in the street yo I probably lay a sleep in a hearse
There's nothing like when you on a mic tearing a track
Then you come from out the booth and start hearing it back
Everybody their love the sound that's why they give you hugs and pounds
Now you know you was spittin it
You got the whole run vibing the same
You ain't doing this for dollars and chains
You got love for the game

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop not for rap yo
Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop not for rap

(Yo I'm feeling you yams do the same thing yo)

For the love of the game
Only deal in dollars and change
Switch places for big faces one and the same
With Snares and kicks prepared to mix
In the booth till I'm dead
No roof on my head
Keep the tools in the shed
Got a place to lay
But a place to stay
That's what I deal with on a day to day
Phone off heat off loan shark spaghetti no meat balls
At least y'all can eat y'all can feel my pain
When a cloudy day feel my rain
No food no drink just hunger pains
Thinkin of that day who this chrome gonna kill
Smiling women face for a home cooked meal
Right now I hate my life
But love the way I write
For real I think I seen my death
Think I like bumming g's from Jeff
Pockets on my cheese on e and they seems on f
I'm a hard working all nighter ass cat see sack song writer worldwide doom ball rider
Feel my blood and tears but the love for the drug got me loved and revered
From these thugs for years
It's the game yo

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap yo
Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap

Yo black it seem like we both feeling the same
Remember when I walked away and you were still in the game
(Uh ha)
That shit was hot I'm still feeling the flame
Plus you never forgot every other verse spilling my name
Chilling with dames to will they range killin their brain with game
If not cousin I be still on the train
Like you said we ain't willing to change
I'm feeling you making
Damn see family and we
Stick together
Shows overseas spit together
No doubt for the love of the game
We gonna keep staying the same
When you not around laying your dame
Getting paper from a play in a lane
Keep heat for any hater wanna test the rap
And even more on the wax so sat Jeff is phat

I attest to that
Still walk with dress room back
Same ghetto
Same whip
Still stressed on whack
Just wanna back y'all nothin less than that
Just want some cash cars and them records with black
It's just a game yo
But whether or not
I still got love for hip hop
It's the game

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap yo
Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap yo
Love what you do
