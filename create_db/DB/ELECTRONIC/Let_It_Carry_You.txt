See day by day pass by
Each week another try
Rushing off the way you feel
Haste off the whats the deal

Won't you loose the amber
And dance the night away

See the migrant birds pass by
Taking off to warmer skies
Hear them singing out their songs
Tune in, realise nothing' swrong

And you come to lose the amber
And then the night away
Boots, and build up tension
Let it carry you away

And this song into the fall
All things near of things gone
To remind of all restless souls
Of the beauty of being here
And have it all
Let it carry your away...

And dance your night away
