Hey, you kind of are successful
You're totally approachable
You're waking up your world view
I feel like I don't know you

You're looking fine in your skin
I'm thinking that I hate you

Uunh, your dreams are coming true now
Persistence has paid off
You're well poised and you're healthy
You're dressing like you're wealthy

You're looking fine in your skin
I'm thinking he can have you

Not a junkie, you're just a groupie
But only a groupie would ever wanna love me

You're looking fine in your skin
And to think I used to f*ck you
