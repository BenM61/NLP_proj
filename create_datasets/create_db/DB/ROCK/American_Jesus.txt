I don't need to be a global citizen
Because I'm blessed by nationality
I'm member of a growing populace
We enforce our popularity
There are things that seem to pull us under
And there are things that drag us down
But there's a power and a vital presence
That's lurking all around

We've got the American Jesus
See him on the interstate
We've got the American Jesus
He helped build the president's estate

I feel sorry for the earth's population
'Cause so few live in the U.S.A.
At least the foreigners can copy our morality
They can visit but they cannot stay
Only precious few can garner the prosperity
It makes us walk with renewed confidence
We've got a place to go when we die
And the architect resides right here

We've got the American Jesus
Fostering their shame on faith
We've got the American Jesus
Overwhelming millions every day

He's the farmers barren fields
The force the army wields
The expression in the faces of the starving millions
The power of the man he's the fuel that drives the clan
He's the motive and conscience of the murderer
He's the preacher on t.v., the false sincerity
The form letter that's written by the big computers
The nuclear bombs and the kids with no moms
And I'm fearful that he's inside me

We've got the American Jesus
See him on the interstate
We've got the American Jesus
Exercising his authority

We've got the American Jesus
Fostering their shame on faith
We've got the American Jesus
Overwhelming millions every day, eah

One nation, under god. One nation, under god. One nation, under god.
One nation, under god. One nation, under god. One nation, under god.
One nation, under god. One nation, under god. One nation, under god.
One nation, under god. One nation, under god.
