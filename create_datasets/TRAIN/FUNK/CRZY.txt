Crazy
I go, I go, I go

Everything I do, I do it with a passion
If I gotta be a bitch, I'mma be a bad one
I'm AI with the designs, du-ragging
Bounce back game two, why we talkin' practice?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Pull up score when I want to
Best thing next to Heaven
They be tryna count me out though
I'm just countin', countin' blessing's
A real woman by the paper
Niggas don't know where I came from
Why I really-really came up
You never could say I'm back in
All this shit I've been through and it made me more real than assassin
I kill 'em, I kill 'em, I kill 'em with compassion
And baby if they askin'

Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
Live for the challenge, only make me stronger
One more reason to turn up on 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy

Lit, lit, lit, lit
Only L I take is to the face
You showed up to see me lose
But I overcome so you overcame
Basic, basic
Ain't nothin' 'bout me basic
I'm crazy, I'm crazy
Better watch what you say to me 'cause
Young Sway got the answers
Give 'em hell, give 'em pressure
Big couch, no manners
Dirty-dirty-dirty dancin'
Take a look at what I did
Go for circle with the wrist
Whippin'-whippin' up the grits
Get a hand full of this nicely
I got it, I got it, I got it
And you gon' respect it
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin', gon' stop me from makin' it happen
So baby if they askin'

Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
Live for the challenge, only make me stronger
One more reason to turn up on 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
