This old road
Leads to the palace of wisdom
I still miss them

Their names are legion on my way
Come in and stay all through the night
And hold me tight

Please do not leave me anymore
It's such a bore
And believe me

You never know when it's enough
Until you know when it's more than enough

Born with a nervous breakdown
Born with a nervous breakdown
Born with a nervous breakdown
Born with a nervous breakdown
