With one stroke of the pen
I tune in to your satellite radio or FM station
I've been patiently waiting to weigh in
Been under construction for two years
But now it's about that time I double dutch my way in
Left foot, right foot steppin' over biters
It's like the game is haunted cause there's so many ghost writers
Me see I'm a lifer with supply that may seem endless
Straight rider like a biker on a chopper with a hit list
Witness the nigga that spit that vicious
Pitbull attack shit when it comes to this rap shit
Daddy fat sax bitch

I know some of ya'll done wrote a nigga off
Like the leases on these cars
And these homes you niggas thought you stayed in
With so many bosses why are they still
Lay ing niggas off they job, nigga for real
Gone give a nigga a gig then
Help a brother get up out this pig pen
But nobody want s to keep it pimpin'
Or a hundred and ten, so with this pen
I begin to illustrate from within, boy
Paint a pretty picture like I'm chilling with my friends
Every body's got a pocket full of ends to spend
See Picasso couldn't blend
Put it all together or fit in
I'm like a crocodile walkin' 'round with alligator skin
Yes I'm is the product of the ghetto where I've lived
Call me Sponge Bob, boy
Soaked up game as a little bitty kid
And never been a lame before the fame I was the shit
And now I'm just big ya dig.

See we not even gonna play with them either
We gone la-la lay it down every fucking time we see 'em
Make the club get crunk yup
We the type of people
But wait, it's not a sequel
No wait, it's BB's prequel
The beginning before the beginning
Spend it how you spend it
Then if you sell dope nigga stack it when you get it
You can't trick it
Or spend it until it's gone
That's slippery business homes
Go get you a business loans
Come on
