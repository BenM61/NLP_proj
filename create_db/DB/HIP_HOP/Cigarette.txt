Do I need you? Am I sure? Not really

You should go tell everybody on mind
Don't keep that shit secret, no no
Baby love it when I do that, I know
You're too pretty to be rolling solo
If you like it, you can take a photo
Don't quit, I know you want me like a bad habit
I'm your nicotine and you're the addict
