There's a girl living in this town
She's a fox and she knows it well
All the fellows for miles around want to get her but they never will
Just to have a girl with so much class
They'd crawl a mile over broken glass
And she'd let em do it just for a game
Deborah's her name

Heart breaking love making connissure

Deborah's her name

She's the kind that never follows fashion
Gotta make up her own
All the other kids quick to catch on act like they've always known
But you should see em when the lights go down
Looking at her as she moves around
Pretty soon they're gonna look the same as the famous Deborah

Deborah's her name

One day when my ship comes in
I'm gonna make her wonder where I've been
I'll get some money and I'll jump in my car
I'll go and make a meal of Deborah
I'll take her driving up to the top
When we get started ain't gonna stop
I'm gonna go and pick that wild flower
And her name is Deborah
