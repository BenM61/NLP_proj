You are not an open book
I can't do nothing 'bout that
But I'm worried, I'm overdrawn
What am I doing up at the witching hour?

Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o

Pick up a book, put down a book
Turn on the TV
It's 2 AM, there's nothing on
I just need something to focus on

Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o

Things are going to slide
Slide out of control
I hope that you come back
I can't eat, can't sleep
When I close my eyes
The thought of you denies
Me, the rest, and the air
That I need

The longer you are far from me
The more I drift away
I didn't see the warning signs
I was falling through the cracks

Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o

Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o
Oh-o-oh-o

You are not
An open book
I am worn and torn
I am overdrawn
