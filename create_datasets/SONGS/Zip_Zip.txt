Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip
Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip

I got a gal
(Zip, zip)
And she's real hip
(Zip zip)
And every time I see her, I just flip
(Zip, zip)

I love her and she loves me
And she's my zip, zip gal you see
She's a ball and full of fun
She's just loved by everyone

Zip, zip
Oh, she's my zip, zip gal
She makes me flip, flip
She makes me flip, flip out

'Cause she's my zip, zip
Oh, she's my zip, zip gal
She makes me flip, flip
She makes me flip, flip out

'Cause she's my zip, zip
She makes me flip, flip
Oh, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip
Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip

Now I got eyes
(Zip, zip)
There good to me
(Zip, zip)
'Cause she's the only girl that I see
(Zip, zip)

I'm her ever lovin' man
She calls me her 'Dapper Dan'
And when she has that zip, zip glow
I open up from head to toe

Zip, zip
Oh, she's my zip, zip gal
She makes me flip, flip
She makes me flip, flip out

'Cause she's my zip, zip
Oh, she's my zip, zip gal
She makes me flip, flip
She makes me flip, flip out

'Cause she's my zip, zip
She makes me flip, flip
Oh, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip
Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip

Zip, zip
Oh, she's my zip, zip gal
She makes me flip, flip
She makes me flip, flip out

'Cause she's my zip, zip
Oh, she's my zip, zip gal
She makes me flip, flip

Oh, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip
Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip
