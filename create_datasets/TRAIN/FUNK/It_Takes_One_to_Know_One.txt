A fool knows a fool,
Like a rainbow knows the rain
A fool knows a fool,
Like a hurt knows a pain
We're two so blue,
But what love has done
It takes a fool,
It takes one to know one

I recognize those tears in your eyes
I know your not having any fun
Won't you come with me,
You need a fools company
Ah-it takes one to know one

Cause a fool knows a fool,
Like a rainbow knows the rain
A fool knows a fool,
Like a hurt knows a pain
And we're two so blue,
But what love has done
It takes a fool,
It takes one to know one

I recognize those tears in your eyes,
I know your not having any fun
Won't you come with me,
You need a fools company
Ah-it takes one to know one

A fool knows a fool,
Like a rainbow knows the rain
A fool knows a fool,
Like a hurt knows a pain
We're two so blue,
But what love has done
It takes a fool,
It takes one to know one
