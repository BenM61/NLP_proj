[Intro: Twista]
Here I am motherfuckers, thought I was gone, huh?
y'all just gonna take my shit and run wit it, huh?
Oh I gotta getcha, I gotta getcha my adrenaline still pumpin'
Kamikaze style, I feel like, I feel like, I FEEL LIKE

[Verse 1: Twista]
Standing in the midst of a hundred thousand haters
Dynamite and see-4 strapped around the waist bloody tears in my eyes
Hit the switch making sure any motherfucker in the vicinity blow away and die
Kill'em off with an explosion get up bitches
Kamikaze on you hoes I'm the sacrificial lamb
Feelin the fury flow out of every follicle in my body
While you decompose die with a blunt of dro in yo hand
I'm uppin the itchy for fuckin wit Twista
If you fuckin wit me come back for you
Cause it won't be an issue
Got some nuts to come get me
Then boy you gon get the picture for flamin my swisher
Then hollows penetrate through your tissue
Fuckin' fed up wit your blood
As I hear the cries of yo homies screamin revenge got no mercy on them either
Go to war wit the intentions to annialate everything you stand for
Wit the death of myself cause I'm a believer
The blessings of sacrifice the messenger who cometh after the Christ
Next one to glisten after ice
Fuckin wit me is a bigger gamble then a pack of dice
I'll murder you and come at you again in the after life
My brother you can't bring harm wit guns
I'm armed wit bombs f*ck all that shit you carry I got your obituary
A motherfuckin phenomenon-cause I'm ah come
Til they put all of us in a cemetery

[Chorus: 2X]
Now come and look into the mind of a man you don't really want to f*ck wit
(Kill'em All, Kill'em All, Kill'em All)
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us

Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
(Kill Us All, Kill Us All, Kill Us All)
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us

[Verse 2: Twista]
Go to war like I'm untouchable
Yellin' out bloody murder while I'm bustin you (bustin you)
2 deadly fingers squeezing twin triggers steady touchin you
Screamin' like a demon like I'm finger fuckin you (fuckin you)
Just put my body in a room wit the enemy and I got a grenade
I'mma pull the pin out the sum bitch
Pop 17 sins out the gun clip
Smoking dro so fire I was on 10 after 1 bligg
Nigga you have now entered the chainsaw massacre
Takin more blood than a 2000 dracula
Slip the clip in the automatic and get to bustin
Horrific hollows while you prayin' to Jesus of Nazarus
A 7 day theory like makaveli flowin on a track that's scary
Wit a Mack in the back of the pelle
Spectacular how could you dare me I'm already willing to die
I'm comin back after they bury me
Its time for your confessions I be the priest
Celebrate and salute the sign of a suicidal soldier
Better become a bible holder
As I start to massacre men with a verbal recital that's colder
Deaths coming closer
As you let kamikaze enter yo body
Careful or you die standing vertical
And anyone that opposes I swear to God I'mma get you
Even if I gotta murder me to murder you

[Chorus: 2X]
Now come and look into the mind of a man you don't really want to f*ck wit
(Kill'em All, Kill'em All, Kill'em All)
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us

Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
(Kill Us All, Kill Us All, Kill Us All)
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
