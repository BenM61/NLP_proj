In a conservatory
I looked at him
He was adjacent to me
I thought about my debts
He was talking about his house
In the Lake District

Come levitate
In the greater hospital
My friends said HMO times three
To the mirth that what you think
The transfer mess backed up two hours
Had to levitate from a grey map - PAID
The snazzy japes of a Basing stoke shot
Basing in stocks
Under the green frock
Below the granite complex
Needed true grit

To levitate
Levitate with me
Levitate with me
Levitate with me
