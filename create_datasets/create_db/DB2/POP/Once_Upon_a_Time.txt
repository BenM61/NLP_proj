And you
Yes you speak to me tonight
And you say so, say so
That once upon a time
When love, love was a white dove
And hope, long live hope, could spin the whole world 'round

I'm talking east to west
I'm talking lost and found
Get up to the mountain top
I'm going to drop unto the ground

That's once upon a time
You raise me up when I know you're around
But God only knows, what God only knows
You lift me up and you spin me around
God only knows, but God only knows

That's time
Time looked around herself
Time got excited
That's when we all got started

Still I hear you, yes still you speak to me tonight
You say then how come out of love, is all this cruelty arising?
Well I said, look, well will you look at you, you're frightened
I see that you smile through weariness
But there is not much else enlightened
Well, that's a question down to time

You lift me up when I know you're around
God only knows, God only knows
Still you raise me up when I know you're around
God only knows, God only knows
That's time
