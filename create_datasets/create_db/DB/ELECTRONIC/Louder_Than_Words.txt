This is my excuse to testify been a beaten down boy
And I don't know why that's alright, that's alright

Well the truth was a lie and I don't know
How it got me to follow and it's true that the lie that was
Sold me will never let me go

What I needed you to
Say was hidden far away 
This is why I've had to justify,
My head is shaken, yeah but that's alright
What I needed to believe was hidden far from me
That's alright 'cause I believe you 

Take advantage of a malleable mind been a weakened sucker boy without
A spine that's alright, that's alright 

Tell me that I've got to fight your fights, and now I'm a bleeding
Boy without a life but that's alright, that's alright

Don't feel bad because I won't cry
I'll do your will
And not ask why,
But that's alright because I believe you
