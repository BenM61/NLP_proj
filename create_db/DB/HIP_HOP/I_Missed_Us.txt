Babe, you say I'm the one that missleaded you
I say you wasn't there when I needed you
You say you wanna know if I'm leavin' you
I say I'll stay only if you step up and start bein' true
Don't let nothing come between me and you
I won't stick around and be a fool for you, baby

You think that I'm giving up
I think that you're sick of us
You forgot we fell in love
What are we both gonna do now?

I think that
You think that
I think that we're not gonna be

I think that
You think that
I think this ain't where I wanna be

I missed us how
We used to make love
I missed us how
There was so much trust
I missed us how
It wasn't 'bout you or me, it was all about us, us

Babe, your attitude seem like you don't want me calling you
So I act like I don't wanna be involved with you
Sometimes I don't know why I fall for you
When you clearly act like you don't want nothing to do with me
We're just getting started and you're through with me
If you really want it you will prove to me (prove to me), baby

You think that I'm giving up
I think that you're sick of us
You forgot we fell in love
What are we both gonna do now?

I think that
You think that (that)
I think that we're not gonna be (oh)

I think that
You think that
I think this ain't where I wanna be

I missed us how
We used to make love
I missed us how
There was so much trust
I missed us how
It wasn't 'bout you or me, it was all about us, us

We've got so much to live for, each other
Let's stop fighting and just fight for each other
Now you know the way I feel about us
Love is waiting right here baby
What are we both gonna do now?

I think that
You think that (I don't think that we're gonna be)
I think that we're not gonna be

I think that
You think that
I think this ain't where I wanna be (I will make it good for me)

I missed us how
We used to make love
I missed us how
There was so much trust
I missed us how
It wasn't 'bout you or me, it was all about us, us

I think that
You think that
I think that we're not gonna be

I think that
You think that
I think this ain't where I wanna be

I missed us how
We used to make love
I missed us how
There was so much trust
I missed us how
It wasn't 'bout you or me, it was all about us, us
