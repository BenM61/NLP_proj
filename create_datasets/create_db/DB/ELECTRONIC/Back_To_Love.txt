Can you feel it? All that space in between us.
I know you could feel it, I miss you just a little too much.

Memories in the breeze are they gone now?
Thought that I would be right but I'm wrong now.
So many feelings, I miss you just a little too much.

We built it all, then let it all crash down (down)
We had it all, but let it burn to the ground.
But maybe we turn around and get back
'Cause right now I'm off track I'm looking for a way back to love
I need you now I'm feignin' for your touch
Come back to love
Come back to love.

Can you see it all that everything we were turned into dust.
Do you believe it? Can we ever get back to us? (Us baby)
