I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'cause I just can't seem to drink ya off my mind

(it's a-honky tonk women)
(gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues)

I layed a divorcee in new york city

I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady, then she covered me in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind
Hey!

(it's a-honky tonk women.)
(gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.)
Yeah, all right
