You're my best friend
But then you died
When I was 23 and you were 25

You're my best friend
But then you died
And how will I survive, survive
Survive, survive?
Oh how will I survive, survive
Survive, survive?

And every day I waited for you
And every day on the top of your car
Every day I waited for you
And every day on the hood of your car

I had a dream of you
You were drifting away
You were sad and the ocean dripped away

And I know, you're gonna be OK
'Cuz I can see in your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Oh no no no, I wanna survive
Survive, survive, survive.

And every day I waited for you
And every day on the top of your car
Every day I waited for you
And every day on the hood of your car

And every day I waited for you
And every day on the top of your car
Every day I waited for you
And every day on the hood of your car
