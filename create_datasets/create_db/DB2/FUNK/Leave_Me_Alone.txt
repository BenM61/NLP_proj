Leave me alone
Read the sign upon my door
Leave me alone
I'm through with love
Can't take it no more

I lost my little guy
Oh, once upon a time
I had him, he walked out
So nothing matters all around

Who needs this mixed up world
Where everyone is out to get you
No one's satisfied until
They let you down, yeah

Keep a telling you
Leave me alone
I got my place on Heartbreak Avenue

Leave me alone
Don't ever want to find
Find somebody new

Who needs this mixed up world
Where everyone is out to get you
No one's satisfied until
They let you down, yeah

Keep on telling you
Just leave me alone
Read the sign upon my door

Leave me alone
I'm through with love
Can't take it
Can't take it no more

Read the sign upon my door
It says leave me alone, uh huh
Read the sign upon my door
It says leave me alone, yeah, yeah
