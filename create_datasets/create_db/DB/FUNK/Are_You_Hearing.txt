Life is a game where nothing is real - only you, only me
Right from the start we chase an ideal - fooling you, fooling me

Are you hearing what I hear
Are you feeling what I feel

you're still no. 1 but they're coming up to get you
Young eyes burning bright they can see a better way
You won't sleep tonight but that's the price you pay

Out of the past the words to a song - calling you, calling me
Hope it will last but time pushes on - pullling you, pulling me

Are you hearing what I hear
Are you feeling what I feel

Every dream you had like balloons they burst around you
So you're on the phone trying to conjure up your past
But the damage has been done
We're too far apart and strangers we've become

And I wonder if it's true
Is the world a different place for me and you

Are you hearing what I hear
Are you feeling what I feel

In out hearts we're still the same
But the worlds we chose to live
In may have changed
And the damage has been done we trust no-one
We're too far apart and strangers we've become
