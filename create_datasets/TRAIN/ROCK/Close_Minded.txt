Everyone tells me I'm close minded
Why don't you listen to this, you might like it
Everyone tells me I'm close minded
You're some hypocrite if you say you don't buy it
Everyone tells me I'm close minded
I'll tell you right now that I'm never gonna try it
Everyone tells me I'm close minded
Give me what I want or there's gonna be a riot

What am I to do
Close-minded

Everyone tells me I'm close minded
Make no mistake, there's no compromise
Everyone tells me I'm close minded
Just try and see it through my eyes
Everyone tells me I'm close minded
I'll tell ya one more time that ya better keep quiet
Everyone tells me I'm close minded
If it's not punk rock, I'm never gonna like it

What am I to do

You know, everybodies always saying "You're really close minded. You only listen to one type of music, you only go to one type of show." And I say "Well you know what, this is the type of music we grew up on, this is the type of music we play. Punk rock is our way of life. It's how we chose to live. And everyone elses opinion is worth nothing. Don't worry about what I listen to, worry about your own life. Because I'm not going to change for you or anyone. I can't help it if you don't like it, and it's upto me if I don't want to listen to anything else. It's what's in our blood, it flows through our veins, so save your breath 'coz we're here to stay!
