She was not one of them 
She never had a friend 
She was the one that got teased 
She was not one of them

She always stands alone
Nobody gave her a chance
She was always pushed around
She was not one of them

She's in love with the devil
She's in love with Lucifer
This is her revenge for all the years of hate and tears
Fire is falling from the sky
She's burning down her past
She starts a new life
To hell with Jesus Christ

Her parents died by accident
She never fell in love with someone
Nobody understood her fear
And every night she cried for help

She prayed to God 'cause she was told to
But he never spoke to her
She felt so cold and left alone
But then the fallen angel came

And then the fallen angel came
To heal the pain inside her heart
Her broken heart
She closed her eyes and saw his goodness
And the truth
She's not alone
He's always there

She's in love with the devil
She's in love with Lucifer
This is her revenge for all the years of hate and tears
Fire is falling from the sky
She's burning down her past
She starts a new life
To hell with Jesus Christ
