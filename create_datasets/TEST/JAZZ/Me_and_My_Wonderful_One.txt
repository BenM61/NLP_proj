Me and my wonderful one,
We haven't got much money, 
But the sky's sunny and blue,
Me and my wonderful one,
Can make the dreams 
I'm dreaming and the schemes 
I'm scheming come true!

Rain or shine, he's all mine,
We beat the millionaires all hollow, 
Live on love is the plan we follow,
Me and my wonderful one,
Ah, baby, we're cozy 
With a cottage cozy and me!

Me and my wonderful one,
We haven't got much money,
But the sky's sunny and blue,
Oh, me and my wonderful one,
Can make the dreams 
I'm dreaming and the schemes 
I'm scheming come true!

Rain or shine, he's all mine,
We beat the millionaires all hollow, 
Live on love is the plan we follow.
Me and my wonderful one,
Now the future's rosy 
With a cottage cozy for two!
