In the cool of the evening
When everything is getting kind of groovy
You call me up and ask me
Would I like to go with you and see a movie?

First I say no, I've got some plans for tonight
And then I stop and and say alright
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you, you

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winking

I get confused, I never know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you

And if you decide someday to stop this little game
That you are a-playing
I'm gonna tell ya all the things
My heart's been a-dying to be saying

Just like a ghost, you've been a-haunting my dreams
And now I know you're not what you seem
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you

Spooky

And if you decide someday to stop this little game
That you are a-playing
I'm gonna tell ya all the things
My heart's been a-dying to be saying

Just like a ghost, you've been a-haunting my dreams
And now I know you're not what you seem
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you

Spooky little boy like you
Spooky little boy like you
A spooky little boy like you
