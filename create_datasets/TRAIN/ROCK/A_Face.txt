A face can be up
A face can be down
A face can be as funny as the face of a clown

A face can show just how you feel inside
When your eyes open up
And your smile opens wide

Your eyes could be brown
Your eyes could be blue 
But there's never ever any other face just like you

When you're sad or crying
And you don't know what to do,
Somebody's face can happen along
And smile the sunshine back into you 

A face can show just how you feel inside
When your eyes open up
And your smile opens wide

Your eyes could be brown
(Or) Your eyes could be blue
But there's never ever any other face just like you

When you're sad or crying
And you don't know what to do,
Somebody's face can happen along
And smile the sunshine back into you
