I'm walkin' out
We never talked it out
Now she's gone so you can knock it out
I'm all alone so I must do without
All the love that I can't live without

Suddenly
She stopped lovin' me
She caught me runnin' round and set me free
Now my misery's my company
And I'm needin' her sweet love calls me
I guess I had it comin'

When a man is being loved
He takes things for granted
Can't see himself falling
He thinks he's on top
But it's not the fall
That hurts him at all
It's the sudden stop

I played around
I did her wrong
And I can't blame that girl for being gone
Well I was cheating on her all along
And I can't blame that girl for being gone
I guess I had it comin'

When a man is being loved
He takes things for granted
Can't see himself falling
He thinks he's on top
But it's not the fall
That hurts him at all
It's the sudden stop
