Anyone can see, all I want to be is by your side
What you do to me make me feel like light up inside
And I don't care what they say, baby
I love your way with me

When I look into your eyes
I see just what I want to see
'Cause you make me believe yeah yeah
You know I dream about you girl, all day

Until the minute I can get away
'Cause I'm in heaven in your arms, all night
And all I want to do is hold you tight
I never knew I could be so in love

I feel like I can never get enough
It can't be wrong because it feels so right
That's why I love you all day, all night
You are all I need, you're my lover and you're my best friend

And I feel incomplete, 'til I;m lying in your arms again
So I don't care what they say, baby
I love your way with me
When I look into your eyes

I see just what I want to see
'Cause you make me believe yeah yeah
You know I dream about you girl, all day
Until the minute I can get away

'Cause I'm in heaven in your arms, all night
And all I want to do is hold you tight
I never knew I could be so in love
I feel like I can never get enough

It can't be wrong because it feels so right
That's why I love you all day, all night
Any one can see all I want to be is by your side
And I don't care what they say, baby, I love your way with me

You know I dream about you girl, all day
Until the minute I can get away
'Cause I'm in heaven in your arms, all night
And all I want to do is hold you tight

I never knew I could be so in love
I feel like I can never get enough
It can't be wrong because it feels so right
That's why I love you all day, all night
