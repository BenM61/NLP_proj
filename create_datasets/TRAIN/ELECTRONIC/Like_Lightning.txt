Like lightning
Do you still like me?
You still into me and you?
I think you kinda crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too
It hit me like lighting
Like a bullet from across the room
I know it's kind of frightening
I guess I really like you too

It's like every little thing you do
Makes me feel funny like I'm back at school
I just want me and you
What's the point of love unless you tell the truth

Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning

Like lightning
Like lightning
Like lightning

Babe you gotta chase me
If you wanna hold these cards
Nothing's gonna phase me
Come and show me who you really are
Could be rolling like thunder
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Never going under
Let's show 'em what it's all about

It's like every little thing you do
Makes me feel funny like I'm back at school
I just want me and you
What's the point of love unless you tell the truth

Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning

Like lightning
Like lightning
Like lightning

I keep my emotions down under
Trying to focus on fun stuff
But I'll bring you lightning and thunder
To power your heart until it functions
Just tell me you're gonna return the feeling
'Cause baby, you know, I give you the real thing
And my love will be a shock to your system
Look nobody can replace my position

It's like every little thing you do
I just want me and you

Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Like lightning

It's like every little thing you do
Like lightning
I just want me and you
Like lightning
Every little thing you say
Like lightning
You can try and walk away
Like lightning
