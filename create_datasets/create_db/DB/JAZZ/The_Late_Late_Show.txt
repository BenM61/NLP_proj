Gee it's cosy in the park tonight
When you cuddle up and hold me tight,
Stars above, they seem to know
We're puttin' on the late late show!

Hear the crazy music in the trees,
See the flowers dancin' in the breeze,
Old man moon begins to glow,
He's joinin' in the late late show!

Birds that should be dreamin'
Start in chirpin' a song.
While fireflies are gleamin',
We kiss, ooh, kiss, ooh, all night long!

Then we amble back to my front door,
Say goodnight and then we kiss some more!
Guess you know I like you so,
It started at the late late show!
