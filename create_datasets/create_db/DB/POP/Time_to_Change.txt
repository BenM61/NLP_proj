Autumn turns to winter
And winter turns to spring
It doesn't go just for seasons you know
It goes for everything

The same is true for voices
When boys begin to grow
You gotta take a lesson from Mother Nature
And if you do you'll know

When it's time to change (when it's time to change)
Don't fight the tide, go along for the ride
Don't ya see
When it's time to change, you've got to rearrange
Who you are and what you're gonna be

Sha na na na na na na na na

Sha na na na na na na na na na

Day by day you're facing the changes you've been through
A little bit of living, a little bit of growing all adds up to you
Every boy's a man inside
A girl a woman too
And if you want to reach your destiny
Then here's what you can do
