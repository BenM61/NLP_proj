Tell them in the city,
Tell them near and far,
This generation coming up, 
Are gonna be proud of who they are,
So you've got to lend an ear, 
Hear what they've got to say,
Maybe you could understand, 
Your way is not the only way.

Cause this generation, 
Is gonna walk with their heads held high,
I know this generation is gonna, 
Bring tears to the old man's eyes.

Mamma said just be proud, 
And hold your head up high,

And a new future might not be far.
