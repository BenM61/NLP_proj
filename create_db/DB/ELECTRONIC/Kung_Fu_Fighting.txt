Now here it is, one to make you move
Something with a funky kung fu groove
Something that'll make you shout
Make you play the crowd
And make you want to turn it out (yeah)
So, honeyz, gather round (right round)
I'll pick you up and take you on
Go pound for pound
'Coz I'm the only man who'll please you
I got a little something that'll tease you (oh oh oh oh)
So throw those hands up high (come one)
Shake your body, move from side to side (that's right)
(Oh oh oh oh) 'Coz we've just begun
Party people in the place
Yeah, we're having fun (oh oh oh oh)
Oh yeah, I'm gonna be a big star
I'm gonna lay it on and go "woo-hah" (oh oh oh oh)
'Coz when the move gets excited (come on)
When everybody's kung fu fighting

Everybody was kung fu fighting, come on (huh) woo-hah
These kids were fast as lightning (ha) woo-chok
In fact, it was a little bit frightening (huh) huh huh
But they fought with expert timing (ha)

(Oh oh oh oh) sing it, girl
Sexy kung fu fighter (oh oh oh oh)
Let me take you higher (oh oh oh oh)
I got the moves, baby
Single-move fighter (oh oh oh oh)
Take you higher (ah yeah)

Dance bright lights, Orinoco flow (so bright)
A kung fu fighter in the disco
He's out to take his chance
He knows the honeyz in the house only go for romance
(He's on the floor) he's got a white suit on
Five past one and the night has just begun
'Coz when he lays it on with style
A ladies' man with a nice smile (oh oh oh oh)
And right before his eyes
Sees a pretty young thing looking real fly (oh oh oh oh) so fly
He wants to make the score
So he takes her hand and leads her to the dancefloor (oh oh oh oh)
He's giving her line after line
She tells him that he looks real fine (oh oh oh oh)
'Coz he's the man of perfect timing
Just like when he's kung fu fighting

Everybody was kung fu fighting, come on (huh) woo-hah
These kids were fast as lightning (ha) woo-chok
In fact, it was a little bit frightening (huh) huh huh
But they fought with expert timing (ha)

(Oh oh oh oh) sing it, girl
Sexy kung fu fighter (oh oh oh oh)
Let me take you higher (oh oh oh oh)
Kung fu fighter everywhere
Throw those hands in the air (oh oh oh oh)
The time has come to turn it out
Everybody, let me hear you shout)

One, two, do the kung fu (One, two, do the kung fu)
Say three, four on the dancefloor (Three, four on the dancefloor)
Come on

Say three, four on the dancefloor (Three, four on the dancefloor)
One more time

Roundhouse kck, karate chop too
I'm gonna teach you all the kung fu
It's an eastern thing, that's what I'm saying
While the retro disco track's playing
Gonna make you shout, make you beg for more
So you get your body on the dancefloor, (come on, girl)
So, boys and girls, you know what to do
Throw those hands up and do the kung fu

Everybody was kung fu fighting, come on (huh) woo-hah
These kids were fast as lightning (ha) woo-chok
In fact, it was a little bit frightening (huh) huh huh
But they fought with expert timing (ha)
