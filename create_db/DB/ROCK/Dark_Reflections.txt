A black star fell down the night I was reborn
A last chance to save us, a last chance to turn dusk to dawn
The vultures they cried out
Their welcome to greet my arrival
The shadows they danced for my death
At the nightmare's trial
The demons of fear tearing my sad soul apart
A horned winged creature laughed out its scorn to the dawn
The sun wasn't able to send down its light, swallowed by thoughts in my mind
Dark was my conscience, I was the last of my kind

[Chorus]
I was dead
Awake in hell
A lonely corpse
To break the spell
A soul in flames
A heart in chains

Can't you see
You must believe
The witchbrew was drained, I couldn't escape my fate
Wrong was this place full with awful disgrace and hate
Sweet ancient memories, fragments of times that have passed
Came to my mind like a blessing with grace for my eyes

[Chorus]
