(Sweet, sweet baby)
When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true (sweet, sweet baby)
Showed them all I had faith in you
I kept on saying

Oh, no, not, not my baby (not my baby)
Oh, no, not my sweet baby (sweet, sweet baby)
He's not like those other guys
Who lead you on (lead you on) and tell you lies (tell you lies)

My mama told me when rumors spread (my mama told me)
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head (my mama told me)
But I didn't listen to what she said
I stood right there (stood right there) and I kept right on saying 

Oh, no, not my baby (sweet, sweet baby)
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
'Cause he's not like those other boys
Who play with hearts (play with hearts) like they were toys

(Not my man, oh, oh, oh)
You might have had a last-minute fling
But I'm so sure it didn't mean a thing
Because yesterday you gave me your ring
And now I'm so glad that I kept on saying

Oh, no, not, not my baby (sweet, sweet baby)
Oh, no, not my sweet baby (not my baby)
He's not like those other guys 
Who lead you on (lead you on) who tell you lies (tell you lies)

Oh, not, not my baby (sweet baby)
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
