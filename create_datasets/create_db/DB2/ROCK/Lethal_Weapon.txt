When you lose your love
And it makes your life turn cold
When it tears you apart
Your heart and soul just can't go on
When love's alive, it sets you free
When it's gone, it's plain to see
How even love can become a lethal weapon

When you lose control
And you scare yourself sometimes
When you really don't care, yeah
That your life is on the line
No one outside can understand
You take your life in your own hands
And even love can become a lethal weapon

Killing you, that's the last thing love
Was ever meant to do
Become a lethal weapon

You know there is no hope of breaking free
And what you suffer happily
That's when love itself becomes
A lethal weapon
