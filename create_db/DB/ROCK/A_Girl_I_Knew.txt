She used to dance when she had the chance and the time it didn't matter
At the end of her night was an endless flight
While her head, it was lost in the laughter.

A girl I knew
Someone I used to talk to
When we'd meet in the middle of a room
A girl I knew
Who wore a shade of blue
Someone I used to talk to.

She used to sing in the night while her ring
It would sparkle like burgundy wine
And the people stopped and stared but pretend she's not there.

She used to dance when she had the chance and the time it didn't matter
At the end of her night was an endless flight
While her head, it was lost in the laughter.
