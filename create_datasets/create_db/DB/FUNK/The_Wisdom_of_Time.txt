Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, the wisdom of time

A baby crawls before he walks
He coos and mumbles before he talks
As the world turns, we live and learn
With the wisdom of time
As the world turns, we live and learn
With the wisdom of time

Growing up through years of wonder
Why some go over and some go under
Life seems strange, but experience is gain
With the wisdom of time

Yesterday we lived separated
But today I thought you'd be integrated
Divided we fall or together stand tall
With the wisdom of time
Divided we fall or together stand tall
With the wisdom of time, yeah

Time
The healer of wounds, the sealer of fate
With the greatest power to educate
Through you wisdom teach us not to hate
Before it's too late

Narrow minds keep us locked up tight
But broader minds are the key to what's right
So let's keep hoping for minds get open
With the wisdom of time, ooh

A baby crawls before he walks (oh, yeah)
He coos and mumbles before he talks
As the world turns, we live and learn
With the wisdom of time

Oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
As the world turns, we live and learn
With the wisdom of time
