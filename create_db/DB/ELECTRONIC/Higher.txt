Now I know how to get down on the floor
Experience the moves you can't ignore
But something 'bout this beat just got me hooked
Come over here and take a closer look

'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground (whoa)
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

I do this just for kicks,
Just for the thrill,
I got this high, without taking a pill
This groove has got me way over the sun
I'm dancing like I am the only one

'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground (whoa)
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky

It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
