Slowly fading blue 
The eastern hollows catch 
The dying sun 
Night-time follows 
Silence and black 
Mirror pool mirrors 
The lonely place 
Where I meet you 
See your head 
In the fading light 
And through the dark 
Your eyes shine bright 

And burn 
Like fire 
Burn like fire in Cairo 
Burn like fire 
Burn like fire in Cairo 

Shifting crimson veil 
Silken hips slide 
Under my hand 
Swollen lips whisper 
My name 
And I yearn 
You take me in your arms 
And start to burn 

F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 
F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 
F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 
Then the heat disappears 
And the mirage 
Fades away 

F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 
F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 
F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 
F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 
F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 
F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 
F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 
F-I-are-E-I-N-see-A-I-are-O 

Burn like a fire in Cairo 
Burn like a 
Fire 
Blaze like a fire in Cairo 
Blaze like a 
Fire 
Flare 
Burn like fire 
Burn like 
Fire in Cairo
