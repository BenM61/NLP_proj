She said, she said, she said
I will never be your queen, ah
 
Oh God who is this
But your beautiful daughter
She may be the cure
But for now she's the torture
 
Oh God who is this
But your beautiful daughter
She may be the cure
But for now she's the torture
 
She said, she said, she said
I will never be your queen, ah
 
She keeps me warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night air
 
She keeps me warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night air
 
She keeps me warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night air
 
In the middle of the night
When we're out on our own
The streetlights, tail lights, moonlight, and disco
Middle of the night
She said maybe
In the middle of the night
Only if it's not a date though
 
In the middle of the night
She's dancing with me
Love live as a pearl
Or clumsy as ivory
I throw her, spin her
We're soaked to the skin
Now I know that what I see in her
She doesn't see in me
 
She said, she said, she said
I will never be your queen, ah
She keeps me warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night air
 
She keeps me warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night air
 
Warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night air
 
She keeps me warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night
Warm in the cold night air
Love you gave us beauty
Love you give us purpose
Love you make us human
Love you warm us in the cold night air
 
Love you gave us beauty
Love you give us purpose
Love you make us human
Love you warm us in the cold night air
 
Cold night air
Cold night air
Cold night air
Cold night air
