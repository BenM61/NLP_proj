You know they don't wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no, 'cause I got you
Anytime you're under the weather
Babe, we can always go
If I gotta pull up on you, on the east side
In the late night, in a disguise
You know I could pull up on you, keep you all night
We could stay right, on the safe side

One way or another
I'mma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"
One way or another
I'mma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"

Baby, they don't wanna see me be happy
'Cause they ain't happy, no
They don't got you
Somethin' 'bout the way we be acting
Babe, we are magical
Might just have to hit me up, on the late night
When it's game time, I don't play nice
I need you to hit me up, on my fake line
Hit that 6-9, yeah, that FaceTime

One way or another
I'mma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"
One way or another
I'mma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"

I'ma save your name under somethin' else
I'ma keep your things deep in myself
I'ma tweet our inside jokes to the outside world
Forget you, go away
I'ma pick you up from the back in trains
Kept you in the world when it's all pretend
You're just you, I'm just me
There's no us, it's nothin'

One way or another
I'mma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"
One way or another
I'mma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"
They don't wanna see it happen
But we say, "F*ck it"
