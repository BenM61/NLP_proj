I woke up this morning... I woke up this morning... Woke up this morning, with the monday morning blues. I couldn't hardly find... I couldn't hardly find... I couldn't hardly find, my monday morning shoes. Monday morning blues... Monday morning blues... Monday morning blues, searched all through my bones. Monday morning blues... Monday morning blues... Monday morning blues, made me leave my home. I've been laying in jail... I've been laying in jail... I've been laying in jail, six long weeks today. Lord, tomorrow morning... Lord, tomorrow morning... Lord, tomorrow morning, gonna be my trial day. Lord, I asked the judge... Well, I asked the judge... Well, I asked the judge, what might be my crime. Get a pick and shoveL... Get a pick and shovel... Get a pick and shovel, let's go down in the mine. That's the only time... That's the only time... That's the only time, I ever felt like cryin'. Well, my heart struck sorrow... Well, my heart struck sorrow... Well, my heart struck sorrow, tears come rolling down. I woke up this morning... I woke up this morning... Woke up this morning, with the monday morning blues.
