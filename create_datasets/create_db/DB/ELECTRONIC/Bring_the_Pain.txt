Lemme tell ya now 
I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain 
Let's go inside my astral plane 
Find out my mental based on instrumental 
Records, hey so I can write monumental 
Methods, I'm not the king but niggaz is decaf 
I stick 'em for the cream, check it 

Just how deep can shit get, get deeper then your fists 
And brothers is mad pissed, accept it 
In your cross colored clothes you crossed over 
Now you're totally crossed out and Kriss Kross 
Who da boss, niggaz get tossed to da side 
And I'm the dark side I am the force of course 

It's the Method Man from the Wu Tang Clan 
I be hectic and comin' for that head piece protect it 
F*ck it, two tears in a bucket 
Niggaz want the ruckus? Yo bust it at me son, now bust it 
Stylez I get buckwild Method Man on some shit 
Fuckin' niggaz foul son, I'm sick 
Insane crazy, Drivin' Miss Daisy 

How the f*ck am I? Now I got mine I'm Swayze 
Is it real son, lemme know it's real son if its really 
Real son, lemme know it's real 
Load it up and kill one 
Load it up and kill one 
Load it up and kill one 
If it's really real 

When I was a little stereo 
I used to be the champion 
I always wonder 
When I will be the number one hey, hey, hey 
And now you listen to me Darcon, Darcon 
And all you niggaz come and test me, test me 
I'm gonna lick out your brains 
Brothers want to hang with the meth bring a rope 
'Cause the only way you hang is by the neck 

Nigga pump off a set comin' through all your projects 
Take it as a threat or better yet it is a promise 
Comin' like a vet on some old Vietnam shit 
You can bet your bottom dollar that I'm on it 
And it'll get even worse word to god it's the Wu 
Comin' through takin' niggaz 'fore they're 
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 

Move'n to your left 
I came to represent and carve my name within your chest 
You can come test, realize it's no contest, son 
I'm the gun who won that old wild West 
Quick on the draw with my hands on the floor 
Lovin' all those goddamn funky rhymes galore 
Check it 'cause I think not when it's hip hop like propa 
Rhymes be the proof when I'm drinkin' ninety proof vodka 
No o.j. no, no straw 
When you give it to me yeah, give it to me raw, I 
Burn 
Give it to me raw 
I burn 
Chest hairs 

I don't need no chemical blow to pull no ho, no 
All I need is chemical bank to pay her up 
Is it real son, lemme know it's real son if its really 
Real son, lemme know it's 
1, 2, 3, 4 
Kill one 
F*ck it up and kill one 
F*ck it up and kill one 
Lemme know it's real.
