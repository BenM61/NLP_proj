Blue evening after a lonely day 
Blue evening spent in the same old way 
My future looks as dark as the skies above me 
There must be someone here in this world who loves me... 
A sweet love song would be so grand to know 
But my love songs are all from the radio 
Another dawn is waiting for me, another day and then 
Another blue evening again...
