Deedely dum dum dum, deedely dum dum
This is the mandolin playing the melody
Here comes the man with the mandolin
Mandolin playing melody again
He'll cheer you up 'til your ship comes in
Loveable old fellow playing an old tune
He comes 'round every afternoon
Raggedy old minstrel, wearing a big grin
You'll love the man with the mandolin
All the kids foller, all the kids holler
To the windows above
Mamma throw a nickle and the man wil tick
A little tune we love
Mandolin plays melody again
Open your heart let the music in
Mandolin again
There goes the man with the mandolin
