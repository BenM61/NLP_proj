Every time (every time)
That I see someone (I see someone)
There's something that they all - always do
They always ask (they always ask)
Yes, they knew what happened too (what happened too)
That little girl I used to see with you
And I just laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
And I tell them that it did not mean a thing

And I just
Laugh it off
Laugh it off
Laugh it off
And I tell them that it did not mean a thing

Every time (every time)
Darling, that I go to (that I go to)
Old familiar places, Darling, we - we used to go
Some old friend (some old friend)
Yes, they knew they'd come up to me (come up to me)
And they'd ask me - yes they do, Darling, about you
And I just laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
And I tell them that it did not mean a thing

And I just
Laugh it off
Laugh it off
Laugh it off
And I tell them that it did not mean a thing

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Love to see me crying Darling
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Not going to sigh now
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Gonna wear a smile Darling
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Gonna hold my head up high now
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Gonna keep on laughing Darling
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
