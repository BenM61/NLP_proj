In a dead end street in Tokyo
Finished my bottle all alone
Where I'll end up well
I just don't know
Another dead end in Tokyo

There's a thousand glowing street signs all in a row
And there's a rich man toasting to the people below
He's just standing at his window sipping
Dom Perignon
Because he feels like the king of Kabuki-Cho waoh oh oh

She's got a suitcase full of big dreams (big dreams)
She's in a city full of bigger lies (bigger lies)
He's Shinjuku James Dean
Keep on living but you never leave alive

Hey mister I got it
Whatever it is you want
Dream on chaotic
Just another dead end in Tokyo, ooh, ooh
Just another dead end in Tokyo, ooh, ooh
Just another dead end in Tokyo

One thousand tired people all scattered like rats
And there's a drunk man sleeping in a pile of trash
He hears the sounds of Karaoke and a Mercedes Benz
He wakes up and checks his reflection in a broken glass
Oh, oh, oh

She's got a suitcase full of big dreams (big dreams)
She's in a city full of bigger lies (bigger lies)
He's Shinjuku James Dean
Keep on living but you never leave alive
Hey mister I got it
Whatever it is you want
Dream on chaotic
Just another dead end in Tokyo
Sister you've got it
I can take you anywhere you want
Dream on exotic
Just another dead end in Tokyo, ooh, ooh
Just another dead end in Tokyo, ooh, ooh
Just another dead end in Tokyo

In a dead end street in Tokyo
Finished my bottle all alone
Where I'll end up well
I just don't know
Another dead end in Tokyo

She's got a suitcase full of big dreams
She's in a city full of bigger lies
He's Shinjuku James Dean
Keep on living but you never leave alive

Hey mister I got it
Whatever it is you want
Dream on chaotic
Just another dead end in Tokyo
Sister you've got it
I can take you anywhere you want
Dream on exotic
Just another dead end in Tokyo, ooh, ooh
Just another dead end in Tokyo, ooh, ooh
Just another dead end in Tokyo
