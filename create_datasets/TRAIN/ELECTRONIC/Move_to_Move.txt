Since you've been gone
I sit alone and watch the same old screen
I carry on
It doesn't matter what it is a sin
I just feel the need to hide away
As I loose myself in Saturday

Look at me I keep turning the pages of history
Look at you trying to fill up your life with things to do
Look at us will we ever find a key in the history
Could it be if I move to you would you move to me

I call you up
(Sorry, I'm not home right now, but you can leave a message)
But all I ever get is your machine
I know you're there
What make you think it could be just a dream
Do you feel the need to run away
Are you searching for a better day

Look at me I keep turning the pages of history
Look at you trying to fill up your life with things to do
Look at us will we ever find a key in the history
Could it be if I move to you would you move to me

How many times changing my mind
How many days wasted away (Wasted away, ooh)
How many words, what will it take? (What will it take, ooh)
How do we work out this mistake (Aaah)

Look at me I keep turning the pages of history
Look at you trying to fill up your life with things to do
Look at us will we ever find a key in the history
Could it be if I move to you, would you move to me?

Look at me I keep turning the pages of history
Look at you trying to fill up your life with things to do
Look at us will we ever find a key in the history
Could it be if I move to you, would you move to me?
