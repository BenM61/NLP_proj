Come home with me
Let's steal away yes sirree
Just you and me
In the land of make believe

Just a kiss or two
And our dreams will come true
That's all we have to do
In the land of make believe

You look so sweet
My life will be complete
Yes we share the love in our hearts
I'll kiss your lips
Your fingertips
And nothin' will keep us apart

Where flowers bloom
Just for you
We'll be happy wait and see
In the land of make believe

You look so sweet
My life will be complete
Yes I'll share the love of my heart
I'll kiss your lips
Your fingertips
And nothin' will keep us apart

Where flowers bloom
Just for you
We'll be happy wait and see
In the land of make believe
