He just finished eating dinner
And stepped outside the cave to smoke
A cigarette he made from rolled up photo paper
They were pictures of things back on earth
He looked out on a greyish white expanse
Of uninhabited terrain he now called home
He'd seen plenty of mirages and imaginary visitors
Up until then so he wasn't sure what to think when
He saw swans and they were wading
On the shores of a pale white lake
That he'd never seen there before
And it was quite beautiful and it was far away
Cause everything beautiful is far away
He knew he was as good as gone
But gone was somewhere he really didn't mind going to
Since the shuttle had crashed many years had passed
And the pictures of his loved ones
That he drew on the walls of the cave had finally faded
He put out his smoke and proceeded
Toward the lake repeating to himself
Toward the lake repeating to himself
Everything beautiful is far away
