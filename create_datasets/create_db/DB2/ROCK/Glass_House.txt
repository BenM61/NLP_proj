Standing here 
Stripped to the bone 
Every line on my face 
Is cut out of stone 

I'm a man in a glass house tonight 
And I only want to treat you right 
I love, I love you true 
I love, I love you true 

You say you want to go 
and find some new thrills 
Hey baby you'll know 
you got to climb that hill 

I'm a man in a glass house tonight 
And I only want to treat you right 
I love, I love you true 
I love, I love you true 

I know that there will be better days 
If we're together then it must be that way 
Stay with me a little bit longer 
We'll both be happy and a whole lot stronger 

Our love, our love, our love 
Baby, maybe we should feel the same way 

Hey baby don't go 
In a little more time 
I'll make you know 
What's good for your kind 

I'm a man in a glass house tonight 
And I only want to treat you right 
I love, I love you true 
I love, I love you true
