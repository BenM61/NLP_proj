You look good but you don't look great
She's got you saying things on tape
You wouldn't tell your best of friends
You think this cycle never ends
Until you are old, it's sad, just how old you are

If you make it out alright
If you make it up for air
I promise you I won't go

(I won't leave before) Before the sun gets to rise
I'll ask this one more time
Will you have me in spite of her?

She has told you what she'd bring
You're entertained by lesser things
You've got to step it up a bit, step it a bit more until
You're sure there's nothing left inside to hurt this pretty mind
'Cause pretty eyes will see right through you

She'll find out
She'll break down
Stop this now

If you make it out alright
If you make it up for air
I promise you I won't go

(I won't leave before) Before the sun gets to rise
I'll ask this one more time
Will you have me in spite of her?

You're barely breathing
You're barely breathing
You're barely breathing tonight

You're barely breathing
You're barely breathing
You're barely breathing tonight

You're barely breathing
You're barely breathing
You're barely breathing tonight

You're barely breathing
You're barely breathing
You're barely breathing tonight

If you make it out alright
If you make it up for air
I promise you I won't go

(I won't leave before) Before the sun gets to rise
I'll ask this one more time
Will you have me, will you have me?

If you make it out alright
If you make it up for air
I promise you I won't go

(I won't leave before) Before the sun gets to rise
I'll ask this one more time
Will you have me in spite of her?
