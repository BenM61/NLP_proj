Rush
Pull me under
The world is at my feet
It's no wonder

Your eyes speak to me
Tell me be calm
Tell me be strong

Swimming out so deep
Now I can't breathe
And it's exactly where I belong

'Cause it feels like a run of a lifetime
And nothing's gonna save us now
Let the waves come crashing down

'Cause it feels like I'm right for the first time
And every time I take you in
I think my heart skip a beat again

I am drowning in your love
Cause I'm drowning in your love

Love
It's taking over
There is no in between till I find me some cover

The tide is coming, I don't know if I can take it
I lose my focus, lose my focus
With every breath I feel my inhibition breaking
I can't control it, no no no'

'Cause it feels like a ride of a lifetime
And nothing's gonna save us now
Let the waves come crashing down

'Cause it feels like I'm right for the first time
And every time I take you in
I think my heart skip a beat again
I'm drowning in your love
