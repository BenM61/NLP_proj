Well, two spinning spheres
Two spinning spheres in a bed of stars
Silence is super, staring into space
I wonder where you are

You're all that I've ever needed
I know that you won't feel it

Drift out into darkness, lost out on horizon
It's alright, it's alright
I'll be your respirator, I'll be your pressure suit
It's alright, it's alright

Violently clear the upper atmosphere
Raging out your hearts
Somewhere far beneath your pointed tongue
And teeth is where you really are

Don't want to be forgiven
But drag you down from where you are

Drift out in the darkness, lost out on horizon
It's alright, it's alright
I'll be your respirator, I'll be your parachute
It's alright, it's alright, ooh, ooh

I'll be your respirator, I'll be your pressure suit
It's alright, it's alright

I will not let you go, oh

Two spinning spheres, they spin together, I'm gon' spin alone
I don't know how I can do this, I don't know how to get through
It's alright, it's alright
I can't stop loving you, I can't stop loving you

I can't stop loving you, I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you, I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you, I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you, I can't stop loving you
It's alright, it's alright

I'll be your respirator, I'll be your pressure suit
It's alright, it's alright
I'll be your four leaf clover, I'll be your pressure suit
I'll be your angel wings, I'll be your parachute
I'll be your running reason, I'll be your only reason, oh

I can't stop loving you, I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you, I can't stop loving you
It's alright, it's alright

I'll be your respirator, I'll be your pressure suit
