My name is Jackson Jameson, a coal miner by trade 
From a part of Pennsylvania even Jesus couldn't save 
With towns named after Indian chiefs and Union Army generals 
It's nowhere in particular but everywhere in general 

History says Americans, we have the right to choose 
But they never mention those of us whose opinions aren't used

Well, the big flood came in '72 and tore the railroad bridges down 
Washed away our only means of getting shipments out of town 
And the government won't subsidize rebuilding the Central Line 
So there's barroom fights and anthracite and loads of extra time 

History says Americans, we have the right to choose 
But they never mention those of us whose opinions aren't used

[Chorus]
There's diamonds in the coal everybody ignores 
A man never finds what he ain't looking for 
A tree only grows if you nurture the seed 
There's too many gems this world doesn't need

The people left like rainwater flowing through an open drain 
But here I sit too proud to admit and too damn old to change 
Now, the monuments at Gettysburg keep the tourists going there 
But we died too slow and quietly for anyone to care 

History says Americans, we have the right to choose 
But they never mention those of us whose opinions aren't used

[Chorus]
