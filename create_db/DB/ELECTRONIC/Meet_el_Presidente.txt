Miss November Tuesday
Bend your rubber rules
Take your time but don't take
Off your high heel shoes
She's in demand at dinner time
She's on the factory wall
And when the gentlemen retire
Guess who's in control?
She blew your money
On taking a cruise
If that isn't funny
Well, watch out teacher...
Ohh ohh, when the chamber's empty
She said, "Ohh, ohh, meet El Presidente"
Dress in flimsy clothing
Use your lipstick line
To cover fear and loathing
With a pink disguise
You never refuse when she lies back
Put a stripe on the union, and a star on the jack
She's on the case at dinner time
She's on the evening news
And if you dare step out of line
You're going to be abused
You may not like it
You may not be scared,
But hell has no fury like a
Young girl's ego
Ohh ohh, when the chamber's empty
She said, "Ohh, ohh, meet El Presidente"
You might adopt an attitude,
Look on the moral side
(Looking on the moral side)
But if police are after you,
Where's the best place to hide?
For this production,
They gave her a gun...
Ain't no director,
So watch out actors!
Ohh ohh, when the chamber's empty
She said, "Ohh, ohh, meet El Presidente"
