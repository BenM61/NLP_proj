In the morning when we see the light
I can see my feelings growing every day.
After loving half way through the night
I can feel my heart beat in a special way.

Visualize a very cozy place
waking up into the morning sun

Squint my eyes and when I see your face -
I know that day by day if you're the loving kind
You'll see that day by day you'll make me loose my mind.
I know that day by day if you're the loving kind

You'll see that day by day you'll make me loose my mind.
In the evening spent a lovely day
Always near you
never felt this good before

Got a feeling want you to stay
'Cause you seem to be what I've been looking for.
Takes a while before I give my heart
Living up and see the sun go dswn
Little smile and then you make me start -
I know that day by day if you're the loving kind
. . .
I know that day by day if you're the loving kind
. . .

I know that doy by day if yov're the loving kind
. . .
