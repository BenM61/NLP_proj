I told lies to your family 
Concerning your whereabouts 
They feel so sorry for me 
I invented jealous stories 
My imagination ran wild 
I made myself so angry 
The night that you insulted me 
I lay awake thinking 

Clever things I could have said 
My thoughts kept turning to Bobby Peru 
How would he handle this one 
'S' is for sorry for all that I did 
Now is the time to turn it all around 
I know what is the matter so why can't I fix it 
Forgive me please 

I had lunch with an old girlfriend 
Who knows all my faults 
And pretends to want to help 
She said I really don't mind 
Your keeping secrets from me 
But please don't keep them from yourself 
Murder is bad, and suicide is sad 
Why would a girl like that put her head in the oven? 
You have your theories, and I got one too 
It's such a waste
