All within the realms of possibility
We were young and fool enough to care
Listening to dealing in senility
Kaleidoscopic patterns in my mind

Call on me baby, call on me
Look at me baby, look at me
Call on me baby, wont you call on me
Look at me baby, wont you look at me

A waste of time to pass away the midnight hour
Smoking on the inside of the bar
Went to save the robots they were everywhere
Ronnie saw a man shot in the head

Call on me baby, call on me
Look at me baby, look at me
Call on me baby, wont you call on me
Look at me baby, wont you look at me
