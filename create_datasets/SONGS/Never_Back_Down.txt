What have you done
Putting aside all I feel
Driving me out your hand on the wheel
I'm only your friend when you depend upon me
Taking your time to get back on your feet

I don't mind if lies keep talking
Never back down it hurts me so much
I don't mind this I'm glad to leave the earth
It haunts me never back down
Get it back

what have you done
Putting aside what's real
Driving me out your hand on the wheel
I'm blaming myself as if nobody else is to blame
Taking your time to get back to your game

I don't mind if lies keep talking
Never back down it hurts me so much
I don't mind this I'm glad to leave the earth
It haunts me never back down never back down
Get it back

just give me back love now
Give me my love now
Just give me back love now
Give me my love now

never back down
Lies keep talking
You never back down
Hurts me so much
Never back down
Glad to leave the earth
Haunts me
Never back down
Hurts me
But you never back down
Hurts me

get it by
Hurts me
You get it by
Hurts me

for love, love
For love, love

never back down
Glad to leave the earth
Haunts me
Never back down
Hurts me
Never back down
Hurts me
Just get it back
