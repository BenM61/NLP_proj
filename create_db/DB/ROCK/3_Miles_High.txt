Every cloud is a silver line
But you still need the moon to shine
And we don't care about it
Is there something that you forgot
And you wish you could stop the clock
Because you can't live without it

We don't have a clue
'Cause we're three miles high
And we rot as dust and feathers fly
And we can't come down
'Cause we'd burst our little bubble on the ground
Whoa oh oh

Everyone has a wall to climb
But we don't really have the time
To give a who ha about it
And your life is a Russian doll
You were given when you were small
And they all inside you

We don't have a clue
'Cause we're three miles high
And we rot as dust and feathers fly
And we can't come down
'Cause we'd burst our little bubble on the ground, oh

And we won't come down
Til we hit the ground

'Cause we're three miles high
And we rot as dust and feathers fly
And we can't come down
'Cause we'd burst our little bubble on the ground, whoa oh
