Peace to all the hip cats, all the nappy sweets 
This is the Brother Question, broadcasting live 
Via satellite, from the Never Never Tunnels 
Now dig the rituals for today, is good music 
So sit back, relax and dig the groove 

Yo bust it, I digs hip-hop, and rocks for hip-hop 
Not R&B because to me that's not my style and 
The are-double-O-quotes ain't for radio, but major soul 
The ones that's hip won't change the dial and 
I remember one morning at the Soul Shack, coolin' 
In the outback, on the songwritin' ship 
Blizz a five, off a Bob Marley spliff 
On the cloud I be relaxin' from last night and shit 
In studio today but hey Brother Question 
Was on the Westside asleep without a clue when 
I hollered down to Crumbs to pick up the phone 
And tell him to get ready (Question, what ya doin'?) 
(Ain't no thing) Yeah
Buttered chicken wings, so I met him in the West 
Where we had to 'lax and wait for Rubber Band and Bes' 
Bassey broke down on the other side of town 
Yo you know what it's about, The Roots is out 
To the subway 

Does anybody like real music? 
Sweet music, soul music? 
You know The Roots is a group that'll choose it 
Just to use it, to make you move it, yeah

From the subway to the studio 
Gots to break fast if we want to get, to the bus 
Runnin' like a Mex for the border 
(Um, yo, oh um, was it a bunch of yas?) 
Nah, just the four of us 
Nuff nappy sweets on the transit, two fine 
(Three fine) fo' five mo' fine, uhh! 

A girl says, "Hey ain't y'all The Square Roots?" 
And I'm like, "Heh, word," 
And then the shorty passed the sign 
Now we got to make out exit (where?) 
To the pavement (to what?) Crushin' trail mix 
(Oh word man, yo look out) Say what? (look out!) 
Question dropped a whole bag of drumsticks 
(Ain't no thing) but a chicken wing, so 
He bends down to pick up the sticks 
And his pants fall down (dang!) 
In my face, Question didn't frown, turned around 
And thought he felt a draft, so I laughed 
(Hahaha)

Here comes the Crumbs, from the chums of the P.O. 
Sprouted from The Roots and I was added to the trio 
Now I'm in cahoots and got a reason for my ego 
In the words of, Los Lobos, adios, amigo 

At the Rat Cave, mic I'm hand, I'm flowin' 
Tellin Question, to keep it, goin' 
What I'm doin', I'm not really knowin' 
But umm, to me see it sounds oh-and-kay'n (it sounds OK) 
Layin', to the sounds playin' 
Um, hi to hoe and, yeah, hey to hay'n (uh-huh) 
Trippin', I'm tryin', not to laugh, bust it 
It's the last paragraph, and I'm done half 
But Question's jokin', and I'm like hopin' 
That nobody comes in and opens, the door
(Ah man, what is up with you man? 
I'm leavin', what why you scratchin' your face like that man? 
Look ugly, self-righteous, do-gooder)
