O hold me O holy O golden O grace
Down here in fear, down where none can
Hear
Any whisper, any word

Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
No sudden moves
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
No sudden moves

Singing sorry to you, and sorry to you
Sleep won't come till I'm sorry to you
For my body and my mind
Singing sorry to you, and sorry to you
Sleep won't come till I'm sorry to you
From my body and my mind

Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
No sudden moves
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
Don't wanna, you wanna
You wanna see it through

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
