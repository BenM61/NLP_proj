If you're Last December came what would you do?
Would anybody remember to remember you?
Did you stand tall?
Or did you fall?
Did you give you're all?

Did you ever find a reason why you had to die?
Or did you just plan on leaving without wondering why?
Was it everything it seemed?
Or did it feel like a dream?
Did you feel redeemed?

In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need to come together
Come together as one

Did you love somebody but got no love in return?
Did you understand the real meaning of love that it just is and never yearns?
When the truth arrives 
Will you be lost on the other side?
Will you still be alive?

In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need to come together
Come together as one

In you're life did you just give a little
Or did you give all that you had?
Were you just somewhere in the middle
Not to good, not to bad?

In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need to come together
Come together as one
