I've got a sandstorm blowin' in my head,
I'm seein' many colours but the only one
That's coming through is red,
And it's stoppin' me dead tryin' to make some tracks
But my feet are feeling like lead,
Stop being blead, stop being blead

Oh my things aren't the same,
Anyone could see that if I stayed much longer,
I'd be tamed
We stopped playing games
I'm not pointing fingers but I'm not gonna take the blame
Playin' all your games, taking all your blames

I said oh no, I don't even care,
I guess I'll be seein' you,
I guess I'll be leaving you today,
We're just not a pair,
I know you've been trying but I just can't bear to tell a lie'
Stop tellin' me all your lies
Stop tellin' me all your lies

Let me take you by the hand,
Try to understand, walk me to a land,
Try to understand,
But I ain't nothing but a man

I've got a sandstorm blowin' in my head,
I'm seein' many colours but the only one
That's coming through Is red,

You know how we feel, we can't go on pretending,
And we've just got to fix the deal,
Gotta make it real
Gotta make it real
