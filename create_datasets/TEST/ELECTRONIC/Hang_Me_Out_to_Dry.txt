Hang me out to dry
Take me for a ride
Do whatever you feel like
You're behind the wheel
Drive

Each night that we go out, she'll put on her red coat
And I know what that means
It means that we're in love and that's enough now
Buckle up and windows down now
Ain't that a little too much for you?
Ain't that a little too much for you?

Hang me out to dry
Take me for a ride
Do whatever you feel like
You're behind the wheel
Drive
Hang me out to dry
Take me for a ride
Do whatever you feel like
You're behind the wheel
Drive

Since we've been going out, I've always take these same roads?
And I've kept the car clean
I remember first night out, let the dance now
Flower shaking in my hands now
Trying to give you something more than
The other ones who came before me

Monday night, running late, getting you from your parents' place
In and out, to the show, trying to fix the radio
Getting drunk, arguing, stumbling off into the streets
Making out, making up, it's alright 'cause we're in love
At the spot on the hill, looking down upon the city
Taking trips silently, all the while you're looking pretty
We begin in the park, sleeping through the midday sun
Talking 'bout history, talking only you and me

Hang me out to dry
Take me for a ride
Do whatever you feel like
You're behind the wheel
Drive

Take me down lonely roads
And to the old spots we know
Yeah, we can go on and on and on
Behind the wheel
Take me down lonely roads
And to the old spots we know
Yeah, we can go on and on and on
Behind the wheel
Drive
