Where are you going
My little one, little one
Where are you going
My baby, my own
Turn around and you're two
Turn around and you're four
Turn around and you're a young girl
Going out of the door

Where are you going
My little one, little one
Dresses and petticoats
Where have they gone
Turn around and you're tiny
Turn around and you're grown
Turn around and you're a young wife
With babes of your own

Turn around and you're tiny
Turn around and you're grown
Turn around and you're a young wife
With babes of your own

Where are you going
My little one, little one
Where are you going
My baby, my own
Turn around and you're two
Turn around and you're four
Turn around and you're a young girl
Going out of the door

Turn around turn around
Turn around
You're a young girl
Going out of the door
