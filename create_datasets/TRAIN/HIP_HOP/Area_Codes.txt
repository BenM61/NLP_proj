Now you thought I was just 7-7-0

It's the abominable hoe man
Globe-trot international post man
Neighbor-dick dope man
7-1-8s, 2-0-2's
I send small cities and states I-O-U's
9-0-1, matter fact 3-0-5
I'll jump off the G4, we can meet outside
So control your whoremones and keep your drawers on
'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bones
3-1-2, 3-1-3, 2-1-5, 8-0-3
Read your horoscope and eat some whore d'oeuvres
Ten on pump one these hoes is self serve

Now everyday is a holiday
So stop the violence and put the 4-4 away, skeet shoot a ho today
5-0-4, 9-7-2
7-1-3, what ya goin' do
You checking up the scene, I'm checking a ho tonight
With perpendicular vehicular homicide
3-1-4, 2-0-1
Too much green, too much fun
I bang cock in Bangkok
Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot
Think not, I'm the thrilla in Manilla, 
Schlong in Hong Kong
Pimp em like Bishop, magic Don Juan
Man after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the motherfucking phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big-ass-sack
I'm slagging this dick like a New Jack, bitch

Is it cause they like my gangsta walk?
Is it cause they like my gangsta talk?
Is it cause they like my handsome face?
Is it cause they like my gangsta ways?
Whatever it is, they love it
And they just won't let me be
I handle my biz, don't rush me
Just relax and let me be free
Whenever I call, come running
2-1-2 or 2-1-3
You know that I ball, stop fronting
'For I call my substitute freak
