I'm getting tired of games
Look at you, a year and a half and you still ain't changed
So I'm out the door
Why you acting like I'm saying something I ain't never said before
When I block the phone
Don't be looking for me at my momma's, leave me alone
I'm sick of you
And all of this drama you putting me through

[Chorus]
If he, really want to be with me
We can start a family
If not then brother move on, move on, just go away
'Cause I ain't got time to play
Working nine to five all day
Know what you can move on, just move on

Don't be coming with no drama, don't be coming with that
Don't be coming with no drama, don't be coming with that
Don't be coming with no drama, don't be coming with that
Move on, keep movin' on

I can't believe you got me feelin' this way
Brother it's not alright, but ya it's OK
Now I be leaving, I be moving away
Don't talk about it, prove it to me to stay
I had to pray when I was hoping to get back with you too
But you ain't ready on the regular be acting a fool
Like confetti in the wind would wherever you blew
But now I'm tired and too old pretend 

You don't understand that bust on line for line
On fam packin' ol' timer rappers, if front of me shining
trying to catch them from behind and
It's true, no man's an island
So I'm through clubbin' and wilin'
No running from commitment, try to do four minute mile now
With you I'm always smilin
Because I love a challenge
You gray girl let me smother you with colour from my pallette
You say I'm trippin' be thinkin' I be talkin' smack
But if I walk out the door baby I won't come back
How many times I done put up with your whinin' ho?
Girl if you don't appreciate me I'mma find someone
I'm always real with it, you know I ain't trying to play
You feelin' me, all my homies say 

[Chorus]

Your mama lookin' at me like (kiss teeth)
What my daughter see in this
Dreadlock captain always have me like I'm being frisked
Bought me a new car, you bang the keys like a pianist
Your mama say she hate it, then why she always be in it?
Plushy in my BM, why I dress this way
Had to tell her Jab rocks like "I'm Shante"
Plus I love your daughter, I treat her like she Nephertiti
And she never needy and she ain't ask me what I bought her
Kinda homey 'cause her moms
was lonely when Pops jetted
The only thing I'm leaving is this podium hot, get it?
So hold tight, no time for pressure play the zone
I'm sure you know I love you, but I heard you on the phone
You said 

[Chorus]
