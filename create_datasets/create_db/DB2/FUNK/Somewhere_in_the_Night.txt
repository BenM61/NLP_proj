Time you found time enough to love
I found love enough to hold you tonight
I'll stir the fire you feel inside
Until the flames of love enfold you

Laying beside you
Lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door
Come with me

Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again

Loving so warm
Moving so right
Closing our eyes
And feeling the light
We'll just go on
Burning bright
Somewhere in the night

You'll sleep when the morning comes
And I'll lie and watch you sleeping
And you'll smile
When you dream about the night
Like it's a secret you've been keeping

Laying beside you
Lost in a feeling
So glad you opened my door
Come with me

Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again

Loving so warm
Moving so right
Closing our eyes
And feeling the light
We'll just go on
Burning bright
Somewhere in the night
