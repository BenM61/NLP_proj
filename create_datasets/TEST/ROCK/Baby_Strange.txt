I see you walking
I see you talking
With all my friends
I'm shadowed under
You're like some thunder
I wanna be your friend

I wanna call you
I wanna ball you
All night long
In winds of passion
My whip is lashing
I wanna get you and then

Ooo you're strange
Don't lame me baby strange
Don't lame me baby

The city's shaking
I ain't faking
Baby this is the end
I'm overloaded
My head's exploded
I wanna get you and then
