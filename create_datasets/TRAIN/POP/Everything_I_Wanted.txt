You were standing like a statue in the light
And it looked like just like perfection in my eyes
When I spoke I staggered from the flow
Once I touched I never could let go, oh, oh, oh
This is what I waited for

Oh, oh, oh
Everything I wanted
Oh, oh, oh
Everything I wanted
For a while

So we whispered every secret we could tell
And we painted lovely pictures on ourselves
Though we hid the parts we did not want to know
As the strength of our illusions took control, oh, oh, oh
This is what I waited for

Oh, oh, oh
Everything I wanted
Oh, oh, oh
Everything I wanted
Oh, oh, oh
Everything I wanted

I never know if my heart tells lies
Caught in a feeling I just can't fight
Thirst like a warning too
Then come back around
Turn the clock back around

Oh, oh, oh, oh
This is what I waited for

Oh, oh, oh
Everything I wanted
Oh, oh, oh
Everything I wanted
Oh, oh, oh
Everything I wanted
