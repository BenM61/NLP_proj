Try me, write it down
On whatever is left to stay
But it means nothin' to me
Try and put it down to
Someone else's mistake
But it's over, it's over
Get high, any higher
And if I get this lonely
I write it down to this moment
Last word for solitude
Long time overdue
But it means nothin' to me
Cause you sit back
While every surf
Hits the rocks
Better than sure
Don't give it away
Get high, any higher
And if I get this lonely
I write it down to this moment
Cause : you want it you want it you got it you got it if you taste it if
You need it if you waste it go chase it
