Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You ask me not to call you on the phone
Well, there's something I've been wanting to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of a song

The glamour of the gay night life has lured you
To places where the wine and iquor flow
Well, you went to be some body else's baby
And forget the truest love you ever know

I never knew there where honky-tonk angels
Oh, I might have know you never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to that wild side of life

Now the glamour of the gay night life has lured you
To places where the wine and liquor flow
Well, you went to be some body else's baby
And forget the truest love you ever know 

I never knew there where honky-tonk angels
Oh, I might have know you never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life

I never knew there were honky-tonk angels
Oh, I might have know you never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life.
