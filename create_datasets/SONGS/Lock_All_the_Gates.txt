By snowy fields and lanes 
She keeps the waiting
In candlelight the sacred 
Alter shines
He suckled the young lambs 
Upon his knee
Giving the weary sleep in peace
He read the stars inside her dream
But he was blind

Of winter's love for spring, 
She kept the vision
Sweet chariots aflame against the sky
He played on the harp sweet melody
Children and emperors came to see
He drove the dragons into the nights
But he was blind

So lock all the gates and 
Bolt the chamber door
Because nobody leaves or 
Enters anymore
Now lock all the gates and 
Bolt the chamber door
Would you lock all the
Gates and the chamber

Come, come
Somebody come and lock 
All the gates and bolt the chamber
Cause nobody leaves or enters anymore

By snowy fields and lanes she 
Keeps the waiting
In candlelight the sacred alter shines
He suckled the young lambs upon his knee
He bid the weary sleep in peace
He read the stars inside her dream
But he was blind, he was blind
