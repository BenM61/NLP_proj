She was a ballerina on a subway train
Stiletto heels and a candy cane
Looked like a number on a station wall
Hot on the tail of a social call

I wet my lips I thought I had it made
Like Valentino with a hand grenade
I made my move with my libido on
She circled once and then she dropped the bomb

She got the big guns
Pointed at my heart
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns
Blew me away
And I went down in flames

I met a sidewalk preacher on a roller skate
He said he had the key to heaven's gate
I said: "I'll wait for the movie 'cause I been there before"
And learned: like is a battle and love is war

She got the big guns
Pointed at my heart
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns
Took me by surprise
She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky

She got the big guns
Pointed at my heart
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns
Blew me away
And I went down in flames

I'm doing time as a back seat Romeo
Play solitaire with my hands in the air
Another night and no bullets to spare

She got the big guns
Pointed at my heart
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns
Took me by surprise
She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky

She got the big guns
Pointed at my heart
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns
Blew me away
And I went down in flames

Big guns (Big guns)
Big guns, blew me away
And I went down in flames

Big guns, big guns
She really, really got the big guns
She shot me down in flames
