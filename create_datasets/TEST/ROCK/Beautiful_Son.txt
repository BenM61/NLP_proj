You look good in my dress
I'll get your friends to clean the mess
You look good in my clothes
I can feel you where the doctor goes

My beautiful son
Yeah, I know

He had ribbons in his hair
And lipstick was everywhere
You look good in my dress
You look good in my dress

My beautiful son
Yeah, I know

You're barren like me
You're barren

My beautiful son
