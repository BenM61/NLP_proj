Every time it rains I listen to the sky
I wonder what's so great about sunshine
So everybody lives and everybody dies
And no one's gonna love you like I do

When its getting dark I 
Didn't need a match I 
Never needed light to see you
You thought I disappeared but
I was always here
I could never get that far from you

Though I misunderstand
And been misunderstood
So love me cause you can 
And not because you should

Every time it rains
I know it's good to be alive
Every time it rains
I know I'm trying to survive

So take it as it comes 
And take me as I am
I never was a good impostor
Well I know how to dream
But, don't know where I stand
And, I'm willing to admit I try to hard
Stop playing with my heart
I'm waiting by the phone
Afraid to be myself
Afraid to be alone

But every time it rains
I know it's good to be alive
Every time it rains
I know I'm trying to survive
And every time it rains
I'm gonna hide myself inside

I know it's good to be alive
I know it's good to be alive
I know it's good to be alive

But every time it rains
I know it's good to be alive
Every time it rains
I know I'm trying to survive
And every time it rains [Repeat x4]
