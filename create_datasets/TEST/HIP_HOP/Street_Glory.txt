Uhh, still out in these motherfuckin' projects
Still a nigga, ain't never gonna get the f*ck up outta here
Niggaz, just don't understand the story

Niggaz die for the street glory
Go to trial, get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And Q.B. the streets call me
So if you see me slippin', reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory

Niggaz die for the street glory
Go to trial, get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And Q.B. the streets call me
So if you see me slippin', reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory

Yo, every time I turn around, niggaz shot, niggaz stabbed
When tonight's pregnant girls strugling to get a cab
Fiends lurkin', D's searchin', pat pockets
Kids put to bed duck, they heads from gas poppin'

Queens bridge slingin', hoppin' our benches
Don status, throw feeds, got sirenges
Poppin' out they arm scratched, now, remember parked jams
Cause' else perfect ways, shell Adidas

Smellin' reefer, way before purple haze
Private stock, peer nigga, with ill walks like Mark Clare
Has tilted wild, niggaz, lickin' shots in the air
Me and Pop was there through the years, our names have switched

Ain't nothin' changed but the names Nostradamus and Blitz
What project is this? Q.B., burnin' in tint
12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
What could you tell me? Niggas, seen it all in this game
When it's all said and done just remember our name

I'm familiar with the dead grass drama, black gates and crime
Embryo of the ghetto born, face and time
Niggas, shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine
Ghetto fame, got a fellow's name draped and shined
How do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?

Where corruptors and new police being recruited
Somehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded
While the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed
Many thought's 'cause I see the past grimly

That could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street
Through all the pap grease and street chases
Sudden raids and confrontations, leadin' the misdeamenor weed cases
I blew smoke through hallway window

Watched the buddah clouds lingo
Pluckin' the blunt brokes from my fingers
My eyes flip different shades
Similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways

Seein' nothing but another day
In this six story rat trap
Them gats clap, another nigga's blazed
Events in my hood rotate

Like the battle on the thirty-eight
Snob in the world of fake love
Before I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs
Coming at you kisses and hugs

When death calls, who's really a thug
The street glory got me deeply in love
Can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it
Got me needin' this drug

Niggaz die for the street glory
Go to trial, get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And Q.B. the streets call me
So if you see me slippin', reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory

Niggaz die for the street glory
Go to trial, get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And Q.B. the streets call me
So if you see me slippin', reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory
