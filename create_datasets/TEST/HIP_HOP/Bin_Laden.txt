Man check this shit out, we was up in Chicago right?
With my nigga Big Hamp, and the nigga pass me a blunt man
Like smoke this shit nigga this some Bin Laden weed
Y'all don't know nothing bout this down South
So I was like, what, what the f*ck is Bin Laden weed?
Man he said that shit is like three different kinds of weed grown all together
He said that shit some straight killer
Them Chicago niggas name that shit Bin Laden weed man, some straight fie!

I swear sometimes I got to get high to hang around my hoe
Sometimes I feel like I got to get high to hang round niggas I know
I sped it up on weed I slowed it down on snow
'Cause I seen so many niggas fall off that blow
One day they got it all and ain't got shit to show
So I came to my natures I had to cut that hoe
So know I'm feeling happy I'm on that binny Bin Laden
And niggas is acting like they don't know what the f*ck just happened
My vision getting blurry I'm about to fall asleep
Or am I dying of OD 'cause this some potent weed
My life start flashing like holograms like right in front
Of my own face I never felt this way on one blunt
I see my son gaining life and my dad losing his
And old girlfriends and niggas I shouldn't hung with
The picture starting to fade it's getting hard to breathe
I'm blacking out with no post up under my shirt and sleeve

Well since I'm on Bin Laden let me tell you a story
'Bout these three pussy rappers who couldn't do nothing for me
Gave a whole lot of cheese said I fucked him his shit
Smoked a whole lot of weed so he seem to forget
Who bought trunks and you cars gave you bitches and hoes
Who told you ass to take a bath when you thought you was raw
Man I tell you he a killer when we talk on the phone
When you see him face to face he'll leave you alone
That's why I'm smoking on this fucking Bin Laden
All my niggas in the hood they got it
Take one little puff you a addict
Take a gun to the head means tragic
Boy I tell you like this we can smoke it anywhere
In front of police station with a six pack of beer
Seven a.m. in the morning just watching people stare
Let 'em point them damn fingers say they wild over there

Ay, ay it's glowing like it's indigo I smell it through the bag
I'm floating like a magic carpet straight from Baghdad
From my brains from my blood from my lungs from the duchess
Can't just let this reefer just escape from my a clutches
'Cause it's the substance I'm loving I'm buzzing
Smoking like a narven huffing and puffing
Came from the Indonesia, Colombian or kaliman
Or it's by the welfare straight from the Taliban

Do you remember me from smoking good weed
Break it down roll it up give it the indo need
Do you remember me from no sticks no seeds
Or you remember me from putting you on this Laden weed
Get yo funds together and come go and see
I'm gone take you on the strip where Bin Laden be
This one blunt action you'll have to smoke and see
Have you choking, falling out with your family
