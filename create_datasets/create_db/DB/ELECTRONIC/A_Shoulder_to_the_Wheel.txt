You're conquered and your blood is pounding 
In your ears 
But you're doing fine 
Find the broken pieces and then start anew 
You make yourself believe that you did 
Something right 
You're denying your only wish 
By forgetting your promises 
Once and for all 

And for ever more 
If you finally reach your aim 
You will never be able to 
Gain back the time you lost between 
You're trying hard to reconstruct your image 
And you're doing right 
But I think that you will always stay like this 
When you put your idle shoulder to the wheel
