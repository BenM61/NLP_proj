They look at me, laugh because I'm different
I laugh 'coz they're all the same
Stuck inside the box
While I'm running circles round the game
They're cold, I'm hot
And I know who I am
Everyone sits down, I stand up
They might walk, but I'm gonna' strut
They fit in, I stand out
Even if I have to shout
I know, I know, I'm not the same
You say yes and I say
No, no, no

Don't care what they say
I do things differently
A weirdo, no cliche
I do things differently
I guess they don't get me
I do things differently
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I do things differently

Put this on the record, literally
I won't stand in a picture perfect shadow of someone
I don't wanna be
And I'm not sorry, but that's just me
You keep it neat and tidy
I color outside the lines
I'm ahead of the game
Turn around they far behind
And I know, I know I'm not the same
You say yes and I say
No, no, no

Don't care what they say
I do things differently
A weirdo, no cliche
I do things differently
I guess they don't get me
I do things differently
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I do things differently

I do, I do it
I do it, do it, do it different
Like, I do, I do it
I do it, do it, do it different
Like, I do, I do it
I do it, do it, do it different
Like, I do, I do it
No, no, no
