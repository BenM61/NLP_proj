Oh

There's a song in my head and it's looking for a way to get out.
I'm all of the things inside, just what I'm screamin' out loud.
These words on my mind, I try to understand what they mean.
And I feel them coming, it's gonna knock you right off of your feet, ooh.

'Cause I always see a sunshine that keeps on following me.
Not a cloud in the sky, 'cause you're always right next to me.
I'll do you no wrong, maybe I should just let it be.
'Cause I know you're gonna have your wicked way with me,
your wicked way with me.

Now the words on my lips are rollin' right out of my mouth.
Baby, give me your hand, I'll take you right out of this town.
Well, nothing's been said and not enough has been done.
Now you're screamin' out loud and not because I'm doing you wrong.

'Cause I always see a sunshine that keeps on following me.
Not a cloud in the sky, 'cause you're always right next to me.
I'll do you no wrong, maybe I should just let it be.
'Cause I know you're gonna have your wicked way with me,
wicked way with me, yeah.

No no baby, no no oh

I always see a sunshine that keeps on following me.
Not a cloud in the sky, 'cause you're always right next to me.
I'll do you no wrong, maybe I should just let it be.
'Cause I know you're gonna have your wicked way with me,
wicked way with me, yeah.
