I think I know now what's makin' me sad 
It's a yearnin' for my old back yard
I realize maybe I was wrong to leave
Better swallow up my silly country pride
 
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I was born
 
Where the weather's better and the rails unfreeze
And the wind don't whistle 'round your knees
I'll put on my weather suit and catch him in the rain
I'll be home before the milk's upon the door
 
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I was born

Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I was born

If anything should happen and my plans go wrong
Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
I'd be singing in the alley if I could 
 
And if I go away and it's my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor I'd be askin' you
Don't bury me here, it's too cold
 
Take me back, carry me back
To the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back
To the Gasoline Alley where I was born
Take me back, carry me back
To the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, won't cha carry me back
To the Gasoline Alley where I was born
