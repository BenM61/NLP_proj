Well, down in Tennessee, close to Mississippi
'Bout a mile out of Toulouse, on the way to Memphis
There's a road turning south that's rather rocky and tricky
But it dead-ends right up to the Club Nitty-Gritty

They do the Mess Around
The Watusi
The Hully Gully
The Mashed Potato
And oh-oh they started Twisting
They did the Shimmy
Ah! They were Jerking
