Damn you, you're so fine
Seems to happen to me each and every time we make love
I can't hold back
It's like having a hundred million little heart attacks
Damn you, baby you're so fine
Damn this kooky love affair
All I ever want to do is play in your hair
To people crazy in love
Into one another like a hand in a glove
Damn this kooky love affair
(damn u)

Like animals just born to breed
Come to think about cha baby
You're my only need
I'm on fire 'til you come and put me out
All I'm trying to say is that my psychedelic shouts
When you damn me
Damn you
When I'm in your arms it's all that I can do
When we're makin' love, I can't hold back
It's like having a hundred million little heart attacks
Damn you, baby you're so fine

Damn you, baby you're so fine

That one's dedicated to all the lovers
That was beautiful
This one's dedicates to the whores
What you just,
Pimp rag, check (pimp rag)
Just once will you talk to me?
Tootsie pop, check (tootsie pop)
Not at me, not around me, not through me?
Raise your cane (cane)
What do you believe in?
God
Who is your God?
You
Is this reality or just another facade?
