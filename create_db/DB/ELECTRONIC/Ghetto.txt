When your Daddy lies and your Mama cries
Never giving you reprieve
And your circumstance is a sinner's dance
Gotta fight what you believe

You've been infected, you lost respect and
And now you're wanting out
That nagging voice has come to bite you
Come to fight you all through the night

There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
From what's in your mind, it's a ghetto
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
From what's in your mind, better let go

Will they crucify and you justify
Never giving up your gun
For an empty chance at a loaded dance
Spinning circles watch them run

Your soul is worn, your will is torn
There's nothing you won't do
Deaf to your cries, your savior's blind
'Cause this state of mind, who will save you?

There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
From what's in your mind, it's a ghetto
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
It's all in your mind, better let go

There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
From what's in your mind, it's a ghetto
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
It's all in your mind, you better let go

There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
There's nowhere to go, your mind can set you free
There's nowhere to run, your mind can set you free

There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
From what's in your mind, it's a ghetto
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
It's all in your mind, you better let go

There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
From what's in your mind, it's a ghetto
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
It's all in your mind, you better let go

There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
From what's in your mind
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
It's all in your mind

There's nowhere to run, your mind can set you free
