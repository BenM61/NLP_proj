Marcheta, Marcheta, 
I still hear you callin' me back, 
To your arms once again. 

I still feel the spell, 
Of your last kiss upon me, 
Since then, life has all been in vain. 

All has been sadness, 
Without you Marcheta, 
Each day finds me lonely and blue. 

My poor heart is broken, 
I want you Marcheta, 
I need you Marcheta I do. 

All has been sadness, 
Without you Marcheta, 
Each day finds me lonely and blue. 

My poor heart is broken, 
I want you Marcheta, 
I need you Marcheta I do.
