There, there used to be a time
You could hurt me, make me cry
Make me hate myself, and now I cry
These tears, and gathered all my pride

I needed to move on
Knew that time would make me sure
I needed space to heal
I had to change the way you make me feel

So don't tell me
You wanna work it out
No, don't tell me
You cannot live without, no

'Cause every little teardrop
Is long gone and stop
Don't tell me that you sorry now
'Cause I don't wanna hear it

You gave every single heartache
But still my heart wouldn't break
The promise is too late
To tell me that you're sorry

You, you have had your chances
But you threw them all away
Saying that you're sorry
Doesn't mean you get your own way

'Cause I'm fed up with excuses
And I won't fall for that
Don't you understand
I'm no longer your girl, you're not my man?

So don't tell me
You wanna work it out
No, don't tell me
You cannot live without, no

'Cause every little teardrop
Is long gone and stop
Don't tell me that you sorry now
'Cause I don't wanna hear it

You gave every single heartache
But still my heart wouldn't break
Promise is too late
To tell me that you're sorry

'Cause you're sorry now, and it's now late
I guess you hope to find me off my face
Well, I'm happy now, didn't treat me right
You can beg and plead but I'm out your life, ha ha

'Cause every little teardrop
(And you're sorry now)
Is long gone and stop
(And is not make)
Don't tell me that you sorry now
'Cause I don't wanna hear it
(I'm better out of life)

You gave every single heartache
(And you're sorry now)
But still my heart wouldn't break
(And is not make)
Promise is too late to tell me that you're sorry
(I'm better out of life)
