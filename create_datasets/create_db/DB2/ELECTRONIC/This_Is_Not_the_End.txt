You close your eyes
And hope that nothing gets through
These walls are high
Got it by a statue
And you've been blind
'Cause it's yourself you consume
But not this time
No I won't let it eat you

Wait, this is not the end
It's where I began
We are up against the world, oh
You know we live for everyday until tomorrow
Hey oh, don't lose your head, we're able
To knock 'em dead
I'll save you
If you're on the edge of Z
This is not the end
This is not the end

This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end

The job is through
Yeah, it is done
I own you
This war is won, won
You play your part
Yeah, you hang on
'Cause you'd rather die in my arms
I'll give you nothing but walking dreams
As you sleep, welcome back all your screams
When you wake, play 'em back, split your seems
So you're breaking 'till you bleed

Wait, this is not the end
It's where I began
We are up against the world, oh
You know we live for everyday until tomorrow
Hey oh, don't lose your head, we're able
To knock 'em dead I'll save you
If you're on the edge of Z
This is not the end
This is not the

This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end

Wait, this is not the end
It's where I began
We are up against the world oh
You know we live for everyday until tomorrow
Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh
Hey oh, hey oh-
This is not the end
This is not the end

End
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
