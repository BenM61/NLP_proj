The closer I get to you, the more you make me see
By giving me all you got (Tell me more) Your love has captured me.


Over and Over again, I've tried to tell myself that we could never be more than friends
And all the while inside I knew it was real
The way you make me feel


Lying here next to you, time just seems to fly
I'm needing you more and more (and more and more)
Let's give love a try (lets give love a try)


Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts in love will find
True love
In a special way


The closer I get 

The closer I get 

To you baby

The more you make me see

The more you make me see

By giving me what you've got

Your love 

captured me


Over and Over again
I've tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew this was real (got to be real)
The way you make me feel (you know)


My baby, my baby, my baby, my love

Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love (BEYONCE- I wanna see into those eyes of love come closer)
Just a little a closer let me speak to you 
I wanna softly tell you something (LUTHER- Here I am, heres my love, I just want you to come closer)
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear 'cause I wanna tell you something (BEYONCE-I wanna whisper in your ear, so soft, so come closer and)
Move on in real close so we can clebrate
The way we feel about each other's lovin'

Luther-
wanna tell you words, words of love, words that make you wanna

both- 
come closer love,
Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love
