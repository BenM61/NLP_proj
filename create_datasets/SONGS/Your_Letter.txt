I read your letter yesterday
If fell between the covers and my bare skin
It fell between my crying
And my longing for you

I loved this one too long
This one much too much
Sometimes I gave just enough of myself
But most times nothing at all

And you've been gone too long
You know I love you the best
You call me crazy, that's how you won my heart
'Cause you were half crazy too

I read your letter again today
Out loud and to myself
It gave me back my sanity
I didn't feel so alone

Won't be too soon
Not like the night
Not like the night on a summer's day
Can't wait to see you step across the room, empty room

Save you and me
I feel your touches in your letters
But it's not half as good as you touching me
In real
