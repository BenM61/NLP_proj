All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need
All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need

There's beauty in the heart of the beast
Fear behind the eyes of the thief
I know you know we're all incomplete
Let's get together and let's get some relief

All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need
All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need

Stronger than a mountain of steel
Faster than hell on wheels
We've got we've got all the power we need
Let's build a playground on this old battlefield

All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need
All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need

Now we're stronger
We no longer want you bringin' us down
We've got the magic
So we're gonna spread the magic around yeah!

Now we're stronger
We no longer want you pushin' us

All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need
All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need

All we are
We are all, all we need

All we are
We are all, all we need
