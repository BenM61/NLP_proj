Broken promises die, like roadkill
There on the side of the street
Concrete casualties of love
Chewed up and spit out
Raise high then dropped down
And now I don't know what's left of me

But I'll collect myself and crawl through the shadows
Reach up my hands to the sky and shout out
I'll never make these same mistakes again
'Cause someone up there holds the key to my heart
I'd do everything to tear it apart
By never allowing myself to let you win

When all I want is for you to see
The side that I don't show to anyone in fear that they may turn and run
Alone and incomplete
No more tears to cry and no more blood to bleed

I'll fall forever endlessly
When you should be the ground beneath my feet
The better half of me

When all I want is for you to see
The side that I don't show to anyone in fear that they may turn and run
Alone and incomplete
No more tears to cry and no more blood to bleed

When all I want is for you to see
The side that I don't show to anyone in fear that they may turn and run
Alone and incomplete
No more tears to cry and no more blood to bleed

I'll fall forever endlessly
When you should be the ground beneath my feet
The better half of me

When all I want is for you to see
The side that I don't show to anyone in fear that they may turn and run
Alone and incomplete
No more tears to cry and no more blood to bleed
