I count my time in dog years
Swimming in sevens, slow dancing in seconds
Oh, and I'm the one that loves you
Oh, and I'm the one that loves you

I spend my time daydreaming
As sure as the sea
It's just you and me
Oh, and I'm the one that loves you
Oh, and I'm the one that loves you

And if you had a bad week
Just let me touch your cheek
Oh, and I'll be there waiting
When you get frustrated
I know things are changing
But, darling, I'm saying
I'll be singing you in all of my songs

Come what may
I'll still stay inside your mind
For all of time
Singing, ooh
We will be alright in the afterlife

Of all that is shifting and shaking my system
I know your rhythm
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know that I'm the one that loves you
Oh, and I'm the one that loves you

And if you had a bad week
Then I'll sing you to sleep
Oh, and I'll be there waiting
If you start to get jaded
I know things are changing
But, darling, I'm saying
I've been here all along

Come what may
I'll still stay inside your mind
For all of time
Singing, ooh
We will be alright

Not in vain, we'll still stay the same
Inside your mind
For all of time
Singing, ooh
We will be alright
In the afterlife
In the afterlife, hmm

I count my time in dog years, dog years, dog years, dog years, dog years
We will be alright (Dog years, dog years)
We will be alright (Dog years, dog years)
In the afterlife (Dog years, dog years, dog years, dog years)
Singing, baby, we will be alright (Dog years, dog years)
We will be alright
We will be alright
