Well, nickel is a nickel, I said, dime is a dime
I need a new gal, she won't mind
Tell me how long do I have to wait?
Can I get you now, I said, must I hesitate?
The eagle on the dollar says "in God we trust"
You say you want a man
You want to see that dollar first
Tell me how long do I have to wait?
Can I get you now, I said, must I hesitate?
Well, If the river was whiskey, said, I was a duck
You know I'd swim to the bottom
Lord, and never come up
Tell me how long
Well, rocks in the ocean, said, fish in the sea
Knows you mean the world to me
Tell me how long do I have to wait?
Can I get you now, Lord, must I hesitate?
Well, the hesitation stalker's got them hesitation shoes
You know, Lord, I got them hesitation blues
Tell me how long do I have to wait?
Can I get you now, Lord, must I hesitate?
Said, can I get you now, how long must I hesitate?
