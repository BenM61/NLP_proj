This fortune brought to you,
Is it worth the pain, the suffering?
Would you rather work sparingly without the stress
Or is there such a thing?
I'm crowded yet unlimited
In this world of free enterprise
I'm shaking down to the rhythm of a lost cause
But certainly it's found by me

Pray hard sing out loud!
I wonder if you'll bother me
I'm twisting back and forth
My eyes are burning stronger now
I'm crowded yet unlimited
In this world of free enterprise
I'm shaking down to the rhythm of a lost cause
But certainly its found by me

Hey 'cause
Are you calling for me
And I'm bored as can be
Without any worries
Hey 'cause
Are you calling for me
And I'm bored as can be
Without any worries
Challenging me

Time Out
Please just a second here to sit and stare
I've wasted time today
I told myself I wouldn't wait
I'm crowded yet unlimited in this world of free enterprise
I'm shaking down to a rhythm of a lost cause but it's certainly found by me

And hey 'cause
Are you calling for me
And I'm bored as can be
Without any worries
And hey 'cause
Are you calling for me
And I'm bored as can be
Without any worries
Challenging me
Should I give up everything?
Should I give up everything?
