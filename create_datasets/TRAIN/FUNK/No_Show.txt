I thought at last love came to pass
In my life there was a chance
To believe in someone new
(Love finally came)
We waited for the perfect day
You and I would slip away
Become one inside our dreams

Oh, but I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came

No show
(You never showed, never came)

You said your love was strong for me
I must face reality
I believed and called your name, oh
(You never came)
Now I'm alone on my way home
Just a fool who played the game
With a love I thought I knew

Oh, yes, I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came

I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I tried to hide my emotions
But my lips kept on saying your name

No show

I thought at last love came to pass
In my life was a chance
To believe in someone new like you
We waited for the perfect day
For you and I to slip away
Become one inside our dreams

Oh, but I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came

No show
(You never showed, never came)

I stood in the falling rain (You never came)
You never showed, never came (Hurt me so, baby, why didn't you show in the 
falling rain)
I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came

I stood in the falling rain (I thought that you loved me)
You never showed, never came (When you and I had made our plans, baby)
I stood in the falling rain (We waited for the perfect day)
You never showed, never came (Darling, I stood in the falling rain)

I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
Stood in the falling rain
And you never showed, never came

I stood in the falling rain (I tried to hide my emotions)
You never showed, never came (But my lips kept on saying your name)
I stood in the falling rain
