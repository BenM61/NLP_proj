Have you ever been so far below
You could only see light using a telescope
Point it up to the sky and wonder why does hope
Feel so far, but look so close

Will you wander with me to the edge
Take a breath, tell the world that we're not finished yet
Cast a net to the stars and see if we can get
Closer to the light at the end

Let our eyes show the fire in our hearts tonight
Yeah, our eyes show the fire in our hearts tonight
Let our eyes show the fire in our hearts tonight
'Cause you can't stop the fire
You can't stop the fire

Maybe I'm crazy
Yeah, a little naive
But the light at the end is brighter than it used to be
Got a long way to go
But I know, I believe
That the light at the end is brighter than it used to be

Ohoh Ohoh
Ohoh Ohoh

You don't have to hide, you know we've all got scars
The broken we were becoming who we are
The proof that it doesn't matter how we start
We can be more than a spark

Let our eyes show the fire in our hearts tonight
Yeah, our eyes show the fire in our hearts tonight
Let our eyes shoe the fire in our hearts tonight
'Cause you can't stop the fire
You can't stop the fire

Maybe I'm crazy
Yeah, a little naive
But the light at the end is brighter than it used to be
Got a long way to go
But I know, I believe
That the light at the end is brighter than it used to be

There's a thin line
Between hoping and believing
A thin line
Between sleeping and dreaming
A thin line
Between paying dues
And losing everything that ever mattered to you

This is our time
This is our life
This is our song
This is our night

And if the world gives up
We'll carry on
Turn the volume up
And we'll sing along

Ohoh Ohoh
(You've got a home)
Ohoh Ohoh
(And you've got a song)
Ohoh Ohoh
(No, you're not alone)
Ohoh Ohoh
(Just sing along)
Ohoh Ohoh
(Through the up's and down's)
Ohoh Ohoh
(When the road gets long)
Ohoh Ohoh
(Know you're not alone)
Ohoh Ohoh

Maybe I'm crazy
Yeah, a little naive
But the light at the end is brighter than it used to be
Got a long way to go
But I know, I believe
That the light at the end is brighter than it used to be

Maybe I'm crazy
Yeah, a little naive
But the light at the end is brighter than it used to be
Got a long way to go
But I know, I believe
That the light at the end is brighter than it used to be

Got a long way to go
But I know, I believe
That the light at the end is brighter than it used to be
