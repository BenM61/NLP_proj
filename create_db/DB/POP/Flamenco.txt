There were stars in your eyes
And guitars that played the flamenco
I reached for charms
You danced out of my arms
So I sang this haunting refrain

Dance gypsy dance gypsy laugh at romance gypsy 
Dance gypsy dance gypsy break every rule
Fly gypsy cry gypsy love will not die gypsy
Now that you captured the heart of a fool
Then we kissed and you sighed

As guitars still played the flamenco
Your sigh seemed to say let us live for today
So I played this haunting refrain

Dance gypsy dance gypsy laugh at romance gypsy 
Dance gypsy dance gypsy break every rule
Fly gypsy cry gypsy love will not die gypsy
Now that you've captured the heart
Of a fool
