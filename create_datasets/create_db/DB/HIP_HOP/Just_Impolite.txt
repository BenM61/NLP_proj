Friday night became so lonely
When you came to make a break
That seemed to take all day to make me angry

'Cause I like you, maybe I'm just like you
Holding on to something that we know we cannot hold
Or fold it seems it seems we just can't forget

Are you frightened by perfection?
Is this who you are, not who you want to be?

I walk the line like Johnny Cash
I made the bus in seconds flat
I called your line too many times
I'm not obsessed just impolite

Sunday came and went so quickly
Now you say you want me back
You will hold on despite my cons

It seems we're meant to hate it being so dependent
But it seems we can believe that we're two peas in this pod
We call New York, gets so lonesome

Are you frightened by neglection?
Am I who you want to see yourself to be?

I walk the line like Johnny Cash
I made the bus in seconds flat
I called your line too many times
I'm not obsessed just impolite

You're stuck on me, you don't know why
Can't leave me anytime you try
They say that everybody cries
So don't think twice 'cause it's alright

Stay here
Touching you, touching the light in your eyes
That keeps coming back

Stay here
Touching you, touching the light in your eyes
That keeps coming back

Stay here
Touching you, touching the light in your eyes
That keeps coming back

Tell I, tell me I do
I, tell me I do
I, tell me I do
I, tell me I do

I, tell me I do
I, tell me I do
I, tell me I do
I, tell me I do

I, tell me I do
I, tell me I do
I, tell me I do
I, tell me I do

I, tell me I do
I, tell me I do
