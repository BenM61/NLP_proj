They call me the voodoo woman
And I know the reason why
They call me the voodoo woman
And I know the reason why
Lord if I raise my name
You know the sky begin to cry

They call me the voodoo woman
I look through water and spied by land
They call me the voodoo woman
I look through water and spied by land
I tell all you men if your woman got another man

I got a rabbit foot in my pocket, a toad frog in my shoes
A craw fish on my shoulder, lookin' dead at you
I got dust from a rattlesnake, I got a black spider bone
If that don't do it baby, you'd better leave it all alone
