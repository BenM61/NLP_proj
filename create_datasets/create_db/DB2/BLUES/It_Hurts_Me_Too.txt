You said you hurtin', you almost lost your mind
The man you love he hurt you all the time
When things go wrong, go wrong with you
It hurtin' me too

You love him more, when you should love him less
Why pick up behind him and take his mess
But when things go wrong, go wrong with you
It hurtin' me too

He loves another woman, and I love you
But you love him and stick to him like glue
When things go wrong, go wrong with you
It hurtin' me too

He'd better leave you, or you better put him down
Because I won't stand to see you pushed around
But when things go wrong, go wrong with you
It hurtin' me, too
