In my dreams I met a girl
Somewhere down the river
She took me to an ancient house
She looked young but also wise
Something made me shiver
She was both dead and alive
And I could see the ravens fly
In the house of silence far from here
Distant voices coming out of the air
The house of silence sends our tears
Shadows dancing for a hundred years
And they cry
(Girl: Give me your love)
I saw her sleep but couldn't hear
What the girl was saying
And sadness filled the misty night
Then I tried to hold her back
While she was slowly fading
Bittersweet was her smile
And I could see the ravens fly
In the house of silence far from here
Distant voices coming out of the air
The house of silence sends our tears
Shadows dancing for a hundred years
And they cry
(Girl: Give me your love)
(Girl: Give me your love)
In the house of silence far from here
Distant voices coming out of the air
The house of silence sends our tears
Shadows dancing for a hundred years
In the house of silence far from here
Distant voices coming out of the air
The house of silence sends our tears...
