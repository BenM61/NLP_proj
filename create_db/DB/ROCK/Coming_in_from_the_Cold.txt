Step inside
A better dream job you could never find
A set of keys and bottles heaven wide
Find yourself a seat and settle in for the ride 

Raise your glass
We're going to drink now till the summer's past
So bring the hats out we all need a laugh
And let the neighbours talk then make sure you lose them 
We can

Try for the right kind of life
I only wish that you'd had a chance to decide
Have a look around you there's no-one there
How can you call this fair

Not to blame
No-one's telling you you're not to blame
Things around they just don't feel the same
And I don't recognise this person that still remains

Settle down
I really hope that you can settle down
Take your tent and trailer out of town
We'll find a place to roam where you could escape to
We can

Try for the right kind of life
I only wish that you'd had a chance to decide
Have a look around you there's no-one there
How can you call this fair

Everybody's waiting for the big surprise
But nobody will notice when it does arrive
So send it on

Try for the right kind of life
I only wish that you'd had a chance to decide
Have a look around you there's no-one there
How can you call this fair

We're coming in from the cold
And everybody's searching for someone to hold
Have a look around you there's no-one there
How can you call this fair
