Trained fighting, coordination
is that a better way for bunker soldiers
oh it's a nasty way to spend a war
along the beaches, the sandy seaside
enlisted bodies the ?
they never taught me how to fight like that
theatrics exercise is so compusive
it's not a better way but it's consensus
I'd give my life just to fight like you

it's not a better way
so we here here to stay
we all do now I seem ok
There's a few of them
in strange directions
it's no use talking
it's it's no decisions
they give our houses to the refugees
the bloody ditches and sober days
sandy trences our alliance
it's kind of worth to hide unseen
the cocky uniforms are universal
your propaganda is losing out here
I'd give my life just to fight like you
I'd give my life just to fight like you
