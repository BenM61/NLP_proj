The rain falls on your days
Giving you a reason for mysterious ways
Behind doors the darkness falls
You pour a cup of coffee, and get talking walls

But you can blame it on me
And the person you thought I wanted you to be
But don't you blame it on love
Cause you will regret it then, and from now on

Besides from days gone by
Hours seem so slow you think you'll surely die
You decide to call up a friend
When she doesn't answer you are close to the end

But you can blame it on me
And the person you thought I wanted you to be
But don't you blame it on love
Cause you will regret it then, and from now on

But you can blame it on me
And the person you thought I wanted you to be
But don't you blame it on love
Cause you will regret it then, and from now on

But you can blame it on me
And the person you thought I wanted you to be
But don't you blame it on love
Cause you will regret it then, and from now on

But you can blame it on me
And the person you thought I wanted you to be
But don't you blame it on love
Cause you will regret it then, and from now on

But you can blame it on me
And the person you thought I wanted you to be
But don't you blame it on love
Cause you will regret it then, and from now on

(and the person you thought I wanted you)
(cause you will regret it then)
