In a fleeting moment of a restless day

Driven to distraction
I was captured by the game.
I have often wondered why I ever wanted to
Leave these scattered hours behind me and speed myself to you.

I choose never to forget

I want our lips to kiss and our limbs to entwine

Let our bodies be twisted but never our minds.
Is this love? Is this love? Is this love? Is this love?
Set to work idle hands
Shake these thoughts

Had I planned them they never would be teasing me
As viciously as these.

I would not have believed you
Had I never seen

Now you and I are intimately pictured
In my dreams.
I could not forsake you or gall tumbling away

And if I live in wonderland
I'm better off this way.
I choose never to forget

Is this love? Is this love? Is this love? Is this love?
Is this love? Is this love? Is this love? Is this love?
