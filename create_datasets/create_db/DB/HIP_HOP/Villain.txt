I'm not gone be your villain anymore
Don't think I'll live a life of keeping score
I know there's something more to life
I'm sure, no, I won't be your villain anymore, anymore

I played my part, I tried to do your way
But now it's time for me to just do me
You see, I don't want to haunt you or be selfish
But I can't be your villain, baby

I'm am not your prisoner
No, you just have to let me go now
And let me be
Who I see in me, yeh
