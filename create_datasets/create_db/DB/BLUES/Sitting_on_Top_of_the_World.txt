I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along, Just rolling along
I'm quitting the blues of the world
Just singing a song, just singing a song
"Glory Hallelujah," I just phoned the Parson
"Hey, Par get ready to call"
Just like Humpty Dumpty, I'm going to fall
I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along, Just rolling along
 
I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along, just rolling along
I'm quitting the blues of the world
Just singing a song, just singing a song
"Glory Hallelujah," I just phoned the Parson
"Hey, Par get ready to call"
Just like Humpty Dumpty, I'm going to fall
I'm sitting on top of the world
