Come to me
My darlin'
Come to me
Then you'll see
How great my love can be
Let me hold you in my arms
Till the storm within you calms
Come to me
My darlin'
Come to me

I have only these wishes
So darlin' would you please
The healing of your kisses
Is my only release

Come to me
My darlin'
Come to me
Let me be
The love I've got to be
I am only just one part
Of your warm and gracious heart

Come to me
My darlin'
Come to me

My words are only water
I hope there never cold
My love like bricks and mortar
I'll build around your soul

I can take good care of all your things
My heart my soul I will always bring
Baby, I will come to the parts
I wouldn't leave you
So don't doubt me
A gone again lover I could never be
Baby, if I died making love to you
You know I'll come back to haunt you
