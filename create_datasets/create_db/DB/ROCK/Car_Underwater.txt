Believe the news, I'm gone for good
Call off the search, no one will know that I'm down here
Believe the note, I left for you
You can't turn back the clocks

You can't pull me up from here, so don't try
I'm in a car underwater with time to kill
Thinking back I forgot to tell you this:
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me,
What hurts more is I would still die for you
I'm in a car underwater with time to kill
Thinking back I forgot to tell you this:
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me,
What hurts more is I would still die for you

Make time slower
Give me longer
It's too late for me
No one will know that I'm down here
Believe your dreams of me sinking
So far below

You can't pull me up from here, so don't try
I'm in a car underwater with time to kill
Thinking back I forgot to tell you this:
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me,
What hurts more is I would still die for youI'm in a car underwater with time to kill
Thinking back I forgot to tell you this:
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me,
What hurts more is I would still die for you

Leave it up to me
to burn in you again.
This one's not your fault.
Please forgive me.

Leave it up to me
To burning you again
This one's not your fault
Please forgive me
Leave it up to me
To burning you again
This one's not your fault
So forget, so forget, so forget me

And don't think back, don't think back on me at all
Just let me go
Don't think back, don't think back on me at all
Just let me go
Don't think back, don't think back on me at all
(Let me go)
Don't think back, don't think back on me at all
(Let me go)
Don't think back, don't think back on me at all

You can't pull me up from here, so don't try
I'm in a car underwater with time to kill
Thinking back I forgot to tell you this:
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me,
What hurts more is I would still die for you
I'm in a car underwater with time to kill
Thinking back I forgot to tell you this:
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me,
What hurts more is I would still die for you

I would still die for you
I would still die for you
And I would still die for you
I would still die for you

And I would still die for you
