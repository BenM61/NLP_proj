Who?

I see yellow
I see orange
I see green
Icy blue
I see every color that has ever been
Inside of you.
If it's boring,
Just ignore me
Don't tell me
Who are you?

Who
Who
Who
Who?

If I wake up
Or we break up
No make up.
Who are you?
When we're fighting
It's exciting
Each other,
Even you
If you give up
Before it's time
You are through.
