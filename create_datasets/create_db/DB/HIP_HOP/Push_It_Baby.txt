It's so many girls in here
It's so many girls in here
It's so many girls in here
It's so many girls in here
(Push up on it)
(Push up on it)
(Push up on it)

[Chorus]
I wanna see you push it, push it, push it
I wanna see you move it, move it, move it
I wanna see you wind it, wind it, wind it
I wanna see you move
I wanna see you push it, baby
Oh, just push that thang on me
Push it, baby; I wanna see you move
I wanna see you

When I step up in the club, I'm so fly, I, I...
Tossing dollars at these bras like ah, ah, ah
Pretty woman up in here like bah, bah, bah
Spittin' game in their ear like la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby blue, I don't play no games
Head to my feet so fresh so clean
Buyin' out the bar like it ain't no thang
Hot boy like Wayne
Diamonds in my chain blang, blang, blang
Got canary diamond clutas (ridin' bustas)
Got the matching Lamborghini same color, mustard
Buyin' drinks for these chicks, sayin' now they owe me
Mo' gin if you wine 
I'm the same ol' G

[Chorus]

Yeah
Rick Rabs, you'll see me by the time I ride, ride, ride
Ridin' in somethin' quick like try, I, I
Leave them haters in the dust like bye, bye, bye
Girl standin' on the corner like la, la, la, la, la, la
You know I pull up on the scene all late twenty-eight
Big place, two dates, leasin' car rates; yes, they gon' shake
Juicy like a milk shake, tender rise like a shake
Don't hate 'cause the oven on my side easy bake
So fly (so fly), no lie (no lie) 
Urban legend in the hood like T.I. 
'Cause I'm rich now, chicks want me to hit now
'Cause I spit rhymes that makes slick 'em da shit now

[Chorus]

Chanel shades in the club like why, I, I
I'm a star, baby; look up in the sky, y, y
See the Pretty Ricky jet flyin' right
I'm fly, I, I, I, I, I
Milli park the Bentley, jump out clean
All eyes on me
Marco Day blue jeans with the fresh tee
Lightin' up in the club like I'm Paparazzi
Call me Mr. Pringles: I'm stackin' my chips
Get up in the club, make 'em rain off rep
She at the post spinnin' like bices 
Snatch two chicks and rolled out like dice

[Chorus x 2]
