Follow me down to the laughing city,
With people changing all their minds; it's crazy.
I want this ma'am, that ma'am, no sir, yes ma'am that sir;
Well, I'll tell you one thing,if you're keeping something...

Then hold on, hold on the to the ones you love.
Hold on, hold on to the ones you love.

Let's not fight, (that's not nice) that is where you'll find me.
Let's not be sore, (that's not right) that is where you'll find me.

Come home late, 
I know you're sick of working,
You're feeling down because your head is hurting, 
So you don't talk.

Then hold on, hold on the to the ones you love.
Hold on, hold on to the ones you love.

Let's not fight, (that's not nice) that is where you'll find me.
Let's not be sore, (that's not right) that is where you'll find me.
