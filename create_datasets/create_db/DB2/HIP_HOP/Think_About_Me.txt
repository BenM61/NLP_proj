Think about, think about me (oh)
Think about, think about me
(Think about me, babe)
Think about, think about me (oh)
Think about, think about me
Think about, think about me
Think about, think about 

I want to be loved like everyone else
I want to be noticed for being myself
I can't exist on once in a while
Waiting around and around was never my style
You play your games perpetually
Never tell me enough
How much you love me
Boy you should know I need more this time
That I'll be the only woman to stay on your mind 

You should think about me
Every minute or two
You should think about me
As much as I think of you
(Now and then)
Now and then doesn't do me any good
Think about me like you should 

I want you to call me
(How many times?)
At least ten times a day
Send lots of letters when you go away
I'm never demanding with presents or gifts
Just think about me that is all that I ask 

You should think about me
Every minute or two
You should think about me
As much as I think of you
(Now and then)
Now and then doesn't do me any good
Think about me like you should 

Appreciation
(Isn't something I take lightly)
I take lightly
(Tell it like it is, girl)
(There's nothing I like better than when you surprise me)
You surprise me
(Consideration, imagination)
'Cause you worship, worship the ground beneath my feet 

Oh, think about me
Oh, think about me
(Like you should)
