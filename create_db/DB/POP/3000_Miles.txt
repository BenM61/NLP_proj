Was I wrong to think that you
Could live like I'm accustomed to?
Your daddy's rich, you could have married
A millionaire or dignitary
But you chose me; are you happy?
Or sometimes is your mind...

CHORUS:
3000 miles away, 3000 miles away
To a life that could have been?
A wife you could have been
I can just give you love, but is that good enough?

When there's a tear in your eye
It makes me almost want to die
I think of what you threw away
To live hand to mouth from day to day
And I wonder, do you think of it too?
Or sometimes is your mind...

(chorus)

So I must love you a little bit more, kiss you a little bit more
Hope you're satisfied so you won't wander...

(repeat chorus and fade)
