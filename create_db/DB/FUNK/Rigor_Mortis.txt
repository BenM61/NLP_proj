I don't see why you won't groove, won't have this dance with me.
Rigor Mortis won't sit, just sit there and you'll see,
The music sounds to good for you to look and act this way.
Just free your mind of all your thoughts and you will surely say yeah!

Are you ready? For the party maker!
Are you ready? For the jazz taker.
Say uh, uh, uh- get on down.
Say it feels good then sure man get on down.
Say you-can't do it like you should.
Then move aside, 'cause ? ain't how to do.
Now get on down! (conversation)

IF you hustle- that's cool.
If you bustop, you know thats cool too.
Say you can't do what you wanna do.
The musics good, I wanna get down wichu.
Say I've got to shake it out the scene.
What's good for you, might not be good for me.
Now get on down!

You shake your hips, you got on down, there's not much more to say.
And now this thing is over, I'd like to go your way.
You say that's not too slick, 'cause ya man couldn't dig it quite that way.
Well, Hey! That's cool, go on home, we'll party anyway.
Now get on down!
