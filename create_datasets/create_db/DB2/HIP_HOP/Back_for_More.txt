You should be right here in this drop top
Or in the sand, on the beach, let our lips lock
Sex me with a view over Mai Tais
No wifi you get to my hotspot
Can I be honest?
Yeah, we both want it, yeah
You're losing focus
I hope you notice

You don't miss a good thing until it's gone
You don't take me serious until I'm done
You don't miss a good thing until it's gone
And you don't take me serious until I'm done

You'll be back for more, yeah, yeah
You won't regret it, (oh yeah!) oh no
You'll be back for more
You won't regret it, (oh yeah!) oh no
No, babe

Pull up, right now
Ain't no need for us to play around
The argues, played out
Broken record, let it fade out
Got me all up in my feelings
You out partyin', I'm chilling
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah

You don't miss a good thing until it's gone
You don't take me serious until I'm done
You don't miss a good thing until it's gone
And you don't take me serious until I'm done

You'll be back for more, yeah, yeah
You won't regret it, no no (won't regret it)
You'll be back for more
You won't regret it (oh yeah!)
No, no

I'll call it payback
If you do (I do)
But we both know what you want on the low (on the low)
His love was faded from your mind
So when I hit you up you come in no time (no whoa)
At my doorstep, you arrive (arrive)
Trench coat on, wearing nothing inside (nothing inside)
You came late, yeah, but you're right on time (right on time)
All I know (all I know)
All I know (all I know)

You'll be back for more, yeah, yeah
You won't be regret it, (oh yeah!) no, no
You'll be back for more
You won't regret it (oh yeah!)
(You won't regret it)
No, no, no
Nah, babe
