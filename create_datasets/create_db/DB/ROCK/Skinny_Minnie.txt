My skinny Minnie is a crazy chick
Six foot high and one foot thick
Well, do I love her? Does a boy love pie?
Well, she is the apple of my eye
Skinny Minnie, she ain't skinny
She's tall, that's all

Oh yeah, she's something else

Well, though her shadow doesn't take much ground
Well, what there is really gets around
Well, what there ain't that's what she be
And even that's way too much for me
Skinny Minnie, she ain't skinny
She's tall, that's all

Yeah, some gal, she is, nice (Incomprehensible)

Well, slightly slimmer than a fishing pole
She's one half rock and the half roll
Well, dig that chick from either side
And man, you'll yell, "Where did she hide?"
Skinny Minnie, she ain't skinny
She's tall, that's all

Man, she's double king-size, three top tall
And she's a long (Incomprehensible) mountain top
