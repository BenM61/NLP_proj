All these words are not a rescue in my eyes
Never sure about the love deep in your smile
Never sure if I'm right or if I'm wrong.
Never sure about the things which were going on and on

All this love just while you were standing near to me
Never sure about the time you spent with me
I can't stand the way you deal with friends of mine
Never sure if love's not just a waste of time.

All these words I try to find to say to you
I can't stand a thousand dreams I dream of you,
while you stand beside me,
while you move into my arms.
