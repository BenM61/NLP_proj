All the years
Alone
The days that pass so slow
As you wasted your time searching for perfection

All the needs
All the ones
All the dreams that came so close
Did you wait for a sign to fly right through your window?
While you missed the answer walking through your door

Hey there oblivious!
Here is your happiness
If you would only turn around
Isn't it obvious?
Mr. Oblivious
Love can so easily be found
Just turn around

If I could be so bold
May I make a suggestion?
You've been searching so long
But in the wrong direction
I've been standing right behind you all this time

Hey there oblivious!
Here is your happiness
If you would only turn around
Isn't it obvious?
Mr. Oblivious
Love can so easily be found
Just turn around

I am here

Hey there oblivious!
Here is your happiness
If you would only turn around
Isn't it obvious?
Mr. Oblivious
Love can so easily be found
Just turn around

Just turn around
Turn around
