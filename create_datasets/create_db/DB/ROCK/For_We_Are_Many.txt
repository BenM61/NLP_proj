Oh yeah!

The fire it rages
It burns clear in the night
Illuminates the path before us
Now true our arrows strike

Defy, we heed the call
Defy, strengthen us all
Defy, for we are many
Rising against you

Defy, we heed the call
Defy, strengthen us all
Defy, for we are many
Rising to crush you

Now the tide is turning
Our might striking fear
Our passion foretells our triumph
Smite those who stand against us

Defy, we heed the call
Defy, strengthen us all
Defy, for we are many
Rising against you

Defy, we heed the call
Defy, strengthen us all
Defy, for we are many
Rising against you

We are your fast approaching doom

Now tremble

Let the tyrants fall
Let the sons raise the call
Let the tyrants fall
We are your fast approaching doom

The fire it rages
It burns clear in the night
Illuminates the path before us
Now true our arrows strike

Defy, we heed the call
Defy, strengthen us all
Defy, for we are many
Rising against you

Defy, we heed the call
Defy, strengthen us all
Defy, for we are many
Rising against you
