As long as he needs me
I know where I must be
I'll cling on steadfastly
As long as he needs me

As long as life is long
I'll love him, right or wrong
And somehow I'll be strong
As long as he needs me

If you are lonely then you will know
When someone needs you, you love them so
I won't betray his trust
Though people say I must
I've got to stay true just
As long as he needs me

If you are lonely then you will know
When someone needs you, you love them so
I won't betray his trust
Though people say I must
I've got to stay true just
As long as he needs me
