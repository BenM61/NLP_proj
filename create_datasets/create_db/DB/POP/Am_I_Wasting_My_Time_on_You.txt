Am I wasting my time
By thinking you're mine
And dreaming the way that I do

Am I wasting the tears
I cried all these years
Just wondering if your love is true

Will I lose in the end
And just be a friend
Please tell me it's time that I knew

Will my heart have to pay
Will you send me away
Am I wasting my time on you

Will it all be in vain
Am I wasting my time on you
