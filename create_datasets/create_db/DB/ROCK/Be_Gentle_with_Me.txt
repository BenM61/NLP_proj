Staring up into the solar system
All the stars are fixed up in the sky
I just want to sparkle for a moment
Before I just fizzle out and die

I'm happy because I'm stupid
Scared of spiders, scared of flying
If I wasn't so happy
I wouldn't be so scared of dying

So just be gentle with me
(I'm not as young as I was)
And I'll be gentle with you

I'm not as brave as I thought
'Cause my heart gets broken so easily
So just be gentle, be gentle with me

Wide awake, waiting like a target
Listening for things I cannot see
Insects flutter up against my window
I don't like the way they look at me

I guess I've always needed
To be needed by someone
It's a comforting feeling
Being under someone's thumb

So just be gentle with me
(And if I am ever mean)
And I'll be gentle with you

I never mean to be mean
'Cause I want to pick peaches off of a cherry tree
Just be gentle, be gentle, be gentle, be gentle with me

So just be gentle with me
Trouble is sometimes
And I'll be gentle with you

I just can't switch myself off when I want to so I never do
Because I'm mental, be gentle, be gentle
Just be gentle, be gentle, be gentle
And I'll be gentle, be gentle, be gentle,be gentle with you
