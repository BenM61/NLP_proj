Dying to please
Dying to serve
I couldn't break out
Didn't have the nerve
Loverman 
At anyone's command 
I woke up lonely
With a glass in my hand
And you found me when my circus was in town
Hallelujah for the singing clown

Walk with me 
Take my hand 
Spend a night 
With a stupid man
I am yours if you can
Fall in love 
With a stupid man

Helpless soul
In a web of love
I didn't get a thing
I couldn't get enough
Drunken tears 
From paranoid eyes
Promises came out lies
And you found me 
When my ship was about to go down
And you carried me back on solid ground

Walk with me 
Take my hand 
Spend a night 
With a stupid man
I am yours if you can
Fall in love 
With a stupid man

Scrap book memories
From a life that has been dead 
Tells me there is no one to blame and therefore
No one to forgive

Walk with me 
Take my hand 
Spend a night 
With a stupid man
I am yours if you can
Fall in love 
With a stupid man
