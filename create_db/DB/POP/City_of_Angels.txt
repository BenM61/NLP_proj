Heaven, is this heaven where we are? 
See them walking, if you dare, if you call that walking
Stumble, stagger, fall and drag themselves along the streets of heaven

Where is the blessed table to feed all who hunger on earth
Welcomed and seated each one joyfully served? 
See them walking, if you dare, if you call that walking
Stumble, stagger, fall and drag themselves along the streets of heaven

Where is the halo that should glow 'round your face
And where are the wings that should grow from your shoulder blades? 
Show them to me
These are sobering sights I've seen in the city of angels 
Have all been one rude awakening that was dues to me in heaven

There would have been heavenly music I was convinced before
A host of the dearly to meet me with hosannas sung at the door
But these are sobering sights I've seen in the city of angels 
Have all been one rude awakening that was dues to me in heaven
In this city of fallen angels
