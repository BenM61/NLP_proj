House on a Hill (Aaron Neville)

Tired of livin in a room without curtains
Tired of sleepin on the floor without a bed
Said if I can't have the good things in life
You know I might as well be dead

I want a house on a hill
A Cadillac and a pool
Now wouldn't that be cool

Tired of wearin them poor mans shoes
And punchin the clock everyday
I'm gonna buy myself a ticket on a choo choo train
I'm gonna make my get away

A Cadillac and a pool
Now wouldn't that be cool
Now I got a woman. Says she's crazy about me
That's why she's with me every morning, y'all
About half past three
She says come on get up, and get on out the door
Because today is only Wednesday and ya got
Thursday, Friday to go

A Cadillac and a pool
Now wouldn't that be cool

A Cadillac and a pool
Now wouldn't that be cool

A Cadillac and a pool
Now wouldn't that be cool

Here comes my boss, All up in my face
He says you know. You better do a good job
Cause you can be replaced

Well lord and I gotta take it
Because the money I need
Because I got you to cry on
And four lil mouths to feed

A Cadillac and a pool
Now wouldn't that be cool
