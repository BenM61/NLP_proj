There you were,
Beautiful
The promise of love was written on your face
You led me on
With untrue kisses
Oh, you held me captive in your false embrace
Quicker than I could bat an eye
Seems you were telling me goodbye
Just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Sweetness was only heartaches camouflaged
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
We used to meet in
Romantic places
Oh, you gave the illusion that your love was real Now all that's left
Are lipstick traces
From the kisses you only pretended to feel
And all our meetings you avoid

And so my world you have destroyed
Just a minute ago your love was here, oh baby
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear, yeah
The way you wrecked my life was like sabotage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
Oh yeah, you only filled me with despair
By showin' love that wasn't there
Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into something I should have dodged, oh
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
Oh, yeah
Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where there's only sand, ooh
You lured me into something I should have dodged
