I keep telling myself I'm fine
Got you on repeat in my mind
I wish that I could lose track of time
But I know that you know that I'll never forget it
'Cause I know the day, and the month, and the second

So you think you can hurt me?
So you think you can cry?
Was it worth all the cheating?
Was it worth all the lies?
Now you think you can message me
Like everything's alright
The funny thing is that you fucked up
But you act all victimised

God knows you hurt me
God knows you hurt me
But it helped me realize
That you're like every other guy
God knows you hurt me
God knows you hurt me
The time is up for you and I
The time is always on my side

I keep telling myself I'm fine
Got you on repeat in my mind
I wish that I could lose track of time
But I know that you know that I'll never forget it
'Cause I know the day, and the month, and the second

I keep telling myself I'm fine
Got you on repeat in my mind
I wish that I could lose track of time
But I know that you know that I'll never forget it
'Cause I know the day, and the month, and the second
(Second, second, second-second-second)

I bet you think that you're pretty
But you're pretty typical
I bet you think that your band's the best
'Cause the girls say that you're cool
But I've been told that your heart broke
So why'd you make me feel
That I could be something more
Than just to help you heal?

God knows you hurt me
God knows you hurt me
But it helped me realise
That you're like every other guy
God knows you hurt me
God knows you hurt me
The time is up for you and I
The time is always on my side

I keep telling myself I'm fine
Got you on repeat in my mind
I wish that I could lose track of time
But I know that you know that I'll never forget it
'Cause I know the day, and the month, and the second
I keep telling myself I'm fine
Got you on repeat in my mind
I wish that I could lose track of time
But I know that you know that I'll never forget it
'Cause I know the day, and the month, and the second

Down to the day, month, second
The girl that you slept with
Tell me, was it worth it?
When you and her got down
To the day, month, second
I won't forget it
Day, month, second
Day, month, second

I keep telling myself I'm fine
Got you on repeat in my mind
I wish that I could lose track of time
But I know that you know that I'll never forget it
'Cause I know the day, and the month, and the second
I keep telling myself I'm fine
Got you on repeat in my mind
I wish that I could lose track of time
But I know that you know that I'll never forget it
'Cause I know the day, and the month, and the second

I know the day, and the month, and the second
