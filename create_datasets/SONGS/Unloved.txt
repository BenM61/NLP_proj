There will be no consolation prize 
this time the bone is broken clean 
no baptism, no reprise and no sweet taste 
of victory. All the stars have fallen 
from the sky 
and everything else in between 
satelites have closed their eyes, the moon 
has gone to sleep 
unloved...unloved...unloved...unloved 

here I am inside a hotel choking on a 
million words I said 
cigarettes have burned a hole and dreams are 
drunk and penniless 
here I am inside my father? arms 
all jagged-bone and whiskey-dry 
whisper to me sweetly now and tell me I will 
never die 
unloved...unloved...unloved...unloved 

here I am an empty hallway 
broken window, rainy night 
I am nineteen sixty-two and I am ready 
for a fight people crying hallelujah 
while the bullet leaves the gun 
people falling, falling, falling and I don? know 
where they?e falling from 
are they 
unloved...unloved...unloved...unloved 

hoping that the kindness will lead us 
past the blindness and 
not another living soul will ever have to feel 
unloved...unloved...unloved...unloved 
unloved...unloved
