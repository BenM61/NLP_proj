I hold my breath when I hear lies
Adore to see your eyes fly
I hold my breath when I hear lies
I'm color-blind when you deny

There is no time to let the blood dry
You are running my heart
Look before you make your beat loud
Can you turn it down

There is no time to let the blood dry
You are running my heart
Look before you make your beat loud
Can you turn it down
Can you turn it down

Illusions fade when feelings rise
I push them under as I hide
Illusions fade when feelings rise
I keep on finding reasons why

There is no time to let the blood dry
You are running my heart
Look before you make your beat loud
Can you turn it down

There is no time to let the blood dry
You are running my heart
Look before you make your beat loud
Can you turn it down
Can you turn it down
Can you turn it down
Can you turn it down
Can you turn it down
Can you turn it down
Can you turn it down
