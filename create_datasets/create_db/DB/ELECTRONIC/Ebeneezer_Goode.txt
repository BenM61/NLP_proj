There's a guy in the place 
He's got a bittersweet face 
And he goes by the name of Ebeneezer Goode 
His friends call him Eezer and he is the main geezer 
And he'll vibe about the place like no other man could 
He's refined, he's sublime, he makes you feel fine 
Though very much maligned and misunderstood 
But if you know Eezer he's a real crowd pleaser 
He's ever so good, he's Ebeneezer Goode 
You can see that he's mischievous, mysterious and devious 
When he circulates amongst the people in the place 
But once you know he's fun and something of a genius 
He gives a grin that goes around from face to face to face 
Backwards and then forwards, forwards and then backwards 
Eezer is the geezer who loves to muscle in 
That's about the time the crowd all shout the name of Eezer 
As he's kotcheled in the corner, laughing by the bass bin 

Eezer Goode, Eezer Goode 
He's Ebeneezer Goode 
Eezer Goode, Eezer Goode 
He's Ebeneezer Goode 
Eezer Goode, Eezer Goode 
He's Ebeneezer Goode 
Eezer Goode, Eezer Goode 
He's Ebeneezer Goode 
He's Ebeneezer Goode 

Has anybody got any veras 
Lovely

Ebeneezer Goode, leading light of the scene 
Know what I mean, see 
He created the vibe 
He takes you for a ride and as if by design 
The party ignites like he's comin alive 
He takes you to the top, shakes you all around 
Then back down, you know as he gets mellow 
Then as smooth as the groove that is making you move 
He glides into your mind with a sunny Hello 
A gentleman of leisure, he's there for your pleasure 
But go easy on old Eezer he's the love you could lose 
Extraordinary fellow, like Mr. Punchinello 
He's the kind of geezer who must never be abused 
When you're in town and Ebeneezer is around 
You can sense a presence in the sound of the crowd 
He gets them all at it, the party starts rocking 
The people get excited it's time to shout loud 

Eezer Goode, Eezer Goode 
He's Ebeneezer Goode 
Eezer Goode, Eezer Goode 
He's Ebeneezer Goode
