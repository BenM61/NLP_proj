Hey Laura it's me 
Sorry but I had to rang your doorbell so late
But there's something bothering me
I really am sorry but it just couldn't wait
Is there someone else instead of me 
Go ahead and lie to me and I will believe
You're not in love with him and this fool can see
That the rivers of your love flow uphill to me

Hey Laura it's me 
Sorry but I had to ring your doorbell so late
But there's something bothering me
I really am sorry but it just couldn't wait
With a healthy dose of make-believe
Won't you lie to me and make me believe
That you're in love with me and this fool can see
That the rivers of your love flow uphill to me

Hey Laura it's me
Sorry but I had to ring your doorbell so late
But there's something bothering me
All night long I just couldn't wait
With a healthy dose of make-believe
Go ahead and lie to me and make me believe
That you're in love with me oh this foul can see
That the rivers of your love flow uphill to me

Hey Laura it's me
Hey Laura it's me
Hey Laura it's me
