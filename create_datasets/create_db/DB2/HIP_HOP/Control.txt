On a one way highway
Only lights to lead the way 
My life left behind me 
The music begins to play 
With the stars to see me
Liberation lifts the shell that's on me 
In a newborn image 
I'm the only one who sees 

Let the music take control 
Only driven by the light that it shows
Don't take away my light 
It's the only thing keeping me alive 

As I'm walking forward
My shadow's got my back 
I'm free from all that binds me 
Still holding things intact 
Now the stars can free me 
As I drift into this melody
In my newborn image 
I'm the only one who sees 

Let the music take control 
Only driven by the light that it shows
Don't take away my light 
It's the only thing keeping me alive 

I found a new life 
Inside this world
I found my light 
I'm not letting go 
Now I see all I've been searching for 
It's all in sight 
I found my life 

Let the music take control 
Only driven by the light that it shows
Don't take away my light 
It's the only thing keeping me alive 

On a one way highway 
And I'm the only one who sees
