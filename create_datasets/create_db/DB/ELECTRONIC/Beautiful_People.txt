I'll smile careful
Beautiful people
You know you're there
I'll smile careful
I can't go back
To know you're there
I'll smile careful

'Till the love is ours
'Till the love is ours
A flap of the wings
And the chaos that it brings

I killed my love
Please come to see
To lose no time

'Till the light goes off
'Till the light goes off
Flies out of the window
But angel stroke your head
To know you're there
I can't go back

(The morning light)
I'll smile careful
Beautiful people
To kill for most (in the morning light)
To lose your goal
I'll smile careful
To know you're there (in the morning light)
And I am fearful

Am I'm gonna fly
To the faces I fly
To know you're there
I can't go back

I planned everything
I planned everything
I'll smile careful
If I had to go
If I had to go
To lose yourself
