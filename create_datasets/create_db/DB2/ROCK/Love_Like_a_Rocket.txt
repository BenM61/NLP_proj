Terry still meets Julie every Friday night
Down at waterloo underground
Nothing much has changed
Except now they're both afraid
But they're not sure what went wrong
Terry holds her tight and says
Some things I can't explain
But in twenty years baby
Some things have got to change
Paradise is gone
If it was ever on
But there's one thing julie
That'll always be the same
My love is a rocket
Like a rocket on fire
Goes straight up to the sky
Love like rocket
Like a rocket on fire
I'm gonna love you till the day I die
But Julie?s not convinced that that's enough anymore
'Cause the waterloo sunset won't work for her anymore

Julie cries a lot but she tries to hide the tears
From the kids coming in from school
She's looking at a picture taken Margate '66
Of terry on the pier looking cool
She tries to remember the boy in the snap
But the baby's woken up from her afternoon nap
She runs a wrinkled hand through her tired hair
Then sighs and mutters something sounding close to despair
But love like a rocket
Like a rocket on fire
He's gonna love her till the day he dies
But in the middle of another little household chore
She knows the waterloo sunset won't work for her anymore

Standing on the bridge terry stops and checks his wrist
As the water rushes by below
It's almost half past six but the people moving by
Make it seem like twenty years ago
Julie gets there late but she always makes him wait
Until the sky turns from red to gold
She says "terry I don't think we should come here no more"
And like he's waited for this moment
He just stares and says "I know"
And love like a rocket
Like a rocket on fire
Goes straight up to the sky
Loves like a rocket
Like a rocket on fire
He'll love her till the day he dies

And then he squeezes Julie's hand as the water starts to glow
A tear falls in the river then disappears with the flow
And is gone
