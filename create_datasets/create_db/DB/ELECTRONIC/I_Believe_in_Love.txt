See it ain't easy for me 
To open my heart and trust a total stranger
But I still believe that love 
Would never put my heart in any danger
I just need to find the one 
Who just wants to show me how beautiful love can be
And even though I am scared 
I know that he's out there just waiting to set me free

(Chorus) 
Like a flower waits to bloom in May
I'll be patient, 'cause I believe in love
I may stand alone but I won't give up
I'll be patient, 'cause I believe in love
Through the fears, even through the pain 
I won't run away, 'cause I believe in love
And eventually love will bring to me
The one for me, 'cause I believe in love

Some say that I should be bitter and untrustworthy
From all that I've been through
But why should I turn on love when it's never turned on me
It's never been untrue
Just 'cause somebody didn't know how to treat me
Doesn't make love the blame
It just means I haven't met my ultimate summer yet
And for it I'm willing to wait

[Chorus:]

I believe in me, I believe in you, I believe in dreams
I believe in fate, I believe in love

[Chorus:]

I believe in love
Do you believe in love
Set me free
Love, love, love, love, love

[Chorus:]
