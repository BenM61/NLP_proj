Twelve o' clock at night, you walk out the door.
You told me baby, you were going to the drug-store.
Well, in my mind, I knew you were lying;
The drug-store closed at a quarter to nine.
I say I saw you kissing Jimmy across the fence,
I heard you telling Jimmy I ain't got no sense.
The way you've been acting is such a drag;
You done put me in a trick-bag.

When I come home, start an argument,
Just to keep you from asking where my voodoo went.
Peep out the front door, I hear the back door slam.
I peek out of my window, somebody's taking it on the lam.
I say I saw you kissing Jimmy across the fence,
I heard you telling Jimmy I ain't got no sense.
The way you've been acting is such a drag;
You done put me in a trick-bag.

We had a fight, then you got mad;
Got on the telephone, called your mom and dad.
Dad said, "She's my daughter and I'm her pa,
And you ain't nothing but a son-in-law."
I say I saw you kissing Jimmy across the fence,
I heard you telling Jimmy I ain't got no sense.
The way you've been acting is such a drag;
You done put me in a trick-bag.

Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah
