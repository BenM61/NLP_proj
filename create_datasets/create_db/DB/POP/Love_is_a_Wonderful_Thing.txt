Birds fly; they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings
The sun shines; it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means

The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good, it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture; it's just a matter of fact

Love is a wonderful thing
Make you smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again

Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love, love is a wonderful thing
Oh yeah

The only thing a river knows
Is runnin' to the sea
And every spring when a flower grows
It happens naturally

The same magic when you're in my arms
No logic can define, oh no
Don't know why, just feels so right
I only know it happens every time

Love is a wonderful thing
Make you smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again

Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love, love is a wonderful thing

Oh, when the cold wind blows
I know you're gonna be there to warm me
That's what keeps me goin'
And our sweet love gonna keep on growin', just keep on growin'

Love is a wonderful thing
Make you smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing, oh yeah
I'll say it again and again

And turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
It's love, love; love is a wonderful
Love, love, love is a wonderful
Love, love, love is a wonderful thing

Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
