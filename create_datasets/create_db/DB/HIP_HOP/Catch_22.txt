And stay, stay, stay, another round
'Cause who wants to live forever?
Who wants to burn it down?
Down, down, down, down
And we can paint the town
'Cause who wants to sing the blues?
So some you win or some you lose
It's all a catch-22

Yeah, I could be getting old, but I'm getting round
Call it immature, sure, but hear me out
'Cause the only thing promised is the here and now
If we didn't live it up, never live it down, yeah
And when I jump I hold on, I'm like, "oh my Lord"
If it all goes wrong then it's all my fault
Man, some just want to watch your world burn
But some on the straight and narrow lost first turn, so
Before you play, take a page of my own advice
It's all a game, know the price when you roll the dice
And what's the rush man? nowhere else to go tonight
And we ain't getting out on time, let alone alive
The choice is yours, your down for the cause
Be hated or adored, but never ignored
And whatever card you draw you can't win them all
So leave the sad songs at the door, get involved and

And stay, stay, stay, another round
'Cause who wants to live forever?
Who wants to burn it down?
Down, down, down, down
And we can paint the town
'Cause who wants to sing the blues?
So some you win or some you lose
It's all a catch-22
It's all a catch-22

Oh, you're not happy where you at heart, f*ck it off then
Just make it not for nothing when you cut your losses
You haven't got it made, but you got your options
Ditch smokes for sleep, ditch shots for crossfit
What you tryna live longer? take a bow
What's the point of all those years if you spend them missing out?
Some of it's worth the risk, hoping you don't forget
Bad as the world can get none of it's permanent
So no politics or parties, even if
We solving world problems with our lager on our lips
And for all the easy ways out, the harder that it gets
Now isn't that ironic? no Alanis Morissette
We a hard act to follow, pouring the bottle
YOLO the motto, could all end tomorrow
Set your watch fast, stay ahead of your time
If you wait, might never arrive, that's the vibe so

And stay, stay, stay, another round
'Cause who wants to live forever?
Who wants to burn it down?
Down, down, down, down
And we can paint the town
'Cause who wants to sing the blues?
So some you win or some you lose
It's all a catch-22
It's all a catch-22
It's all a catch-22

Some paint the town (some paint the town)
Some sing the blues (some sing the blues)
Oh some you win, oh some you lose
It's all a catch-22
Some paint the town (some paint the town)
Some sing the blues (some sing the blues)
Oh some you win, oh some you lose
It's all a catch-22

Oh some you win, oh some you lose
It's all a catch-22

Oh some you win, oh some you lose
It's all a catch-22
