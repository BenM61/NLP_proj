Every day I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
that I can understand, yes I am

In the days between the hours
I read towers, bloody flowers
Push their heads into the air
I don't every care if I ever know
There I go

Don't push your love too far
Your wounds won't leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a Broken dream

Did someone bother you
Did someone break the bread
Good people are in bed
Before 9 o'clock

On the pad before my eyes
Paper cry's telling lies
The promises you gave from the grave
Of a broken heart

Every day I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
that I can understand, yes I am

I sit here in my lonely room

Don't push your love too far
Your wounds won't leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a Broken dream

Now don't you forget what I say
