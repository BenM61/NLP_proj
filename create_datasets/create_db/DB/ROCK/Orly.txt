Well, if you ever been to Paris and you ever missed a plane
Nothin' much to do but sit around
Drink a little, yawn a couple, laugh at where you come from
Have another glass of Paris Brown

I'm alone and they're still jivin'
He plugged himself in and left her screamin'

Planes are goin' up
Planes are comin' down
Bells around here about enough to drive a poor boy mad

Planes are goin' up
Planes are comin' down
Better get to Rome and have a look at younger sister of my dad

Well, the mission was accomplished on the day that you arrived
Maria hung you out and let you dry
You never understood the language lesson that she gave you
Caught it in reflection of her eye

I'm alone and they're still jivin'
He plugged himself in and left her droolin'

Planes are goin' up
Planes are comin' down
Bells around here about enough to drive a poor boy mad

Planes are goin' up
Planes are comin' down
Better get to Rome and have a look at younger sister of my dad
