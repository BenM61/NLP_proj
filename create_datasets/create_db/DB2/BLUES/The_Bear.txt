I've been living with the Bear
In a big house full of blues
Going back through the years
Hear any record you choose

The sun is shining down
And the Bear is rolling in the shade
Everybody is gonna boogie
Blues roll night and day
Turn on all of the people
Who got no place to stay

All the men of Canned Heat
Are part of my family
I'm gonna remember
The things they did for me

I got to be moving
They call me Wandering John
I'll see you, old Bear
I'll be back 'fore long
