Well now I guess it's time for me to wreck shop
So show your peace while the beat drops
And if you're in the house just throw your hands up
And let me see my brothers and sisters spread love
And if you're not down there's something wrong see
'Cause see my project homies, they got my back G
Droppin' a old school with a new school
PA's in the house and it's a good thing

Well if you down with the clique
Let me hear you say (I'm down wit it)

Well if you down with the clique
Let me hear you say (I'm down wit it)

Well if you down with the clique
Let me hear you say (I'm down wit it)

Well if you down with the clique
Let me hear you say (I'm down wit it)

Now it's a phone checker, I musn't do this
And if you didn't know I thought you knew this
It took a little time but now it's on see
You been waiting for so long to beep me
So check check check it out, all the dogs in the house (woof woof woof)
So pump your fist in the air and say
R. Kelly's on the track and it's a good thing

Well if you down with the clique
Let me hear you say (I'm down wit it)

Well if you down with the clique
Let me hear you say (I'm down wit it)

Well if you down with the clique
Let me hear you say (I'm down wit it)

Well if you down with the clique
Let me hear you say (I'm down wit it)
