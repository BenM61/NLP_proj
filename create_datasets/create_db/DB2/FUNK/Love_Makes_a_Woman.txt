When the fire, it was burning
But I know, I should have been learning
And my pockets were full of money
I had someone, yes I did, to call my honey

And it's love that makes a woman
And it's love that makes a woman

Something told me that this wouldn't last
My money is in the past
I had to swallow all my pride
And admit to myself deep down inside

Diamonds and pearls, I, I've had enough
But I feel so much better dressed in love

And it's love that makes a woman
And it's love that makes a woman
What she is, yeah, what she is, hey, yeah

And it's love that makes a woman
And it's love that makes a woman
What she is, yeah, what she is, hey, yeah

It's love, it's love, it's love
That makes a woman
