I can hear her in the background 
But she's a witch 
Because she knew it was me 
And she always did 
I'm just glad you listen 
Even though It's not true 
I'm glad you're doing 
What you need to do

We've all tried 
And all failed 

To turn you
Turn you 
Turn you around 

You leave me hanging 
On the outside of an open line 
You never speak 
You're confident most of the time 
Take as much as you need 
Don't be shy 

We've all tried 
And all failed 

To turn you
Turn you 
Turn you around 

(I have waited an hour 
To get you on the phone 
Tell you the good news 
Before you left home
I hope you get what you've been looking for

It will be right for you 
It will be right for you ...
It will be right for you 
Though it won't fit)
