There's a spell on my mind
And you're to blame
Nothing else in my life
Will ever be the same

It must be love
For this is nothing that I won't do
For the love of you
From now on
Every thing that I have is yours forever

This is straight from the heart
No one could ever doubt
My love will last till the end of time
Of time

What am I to do
With the love I found (With the love I found)
I can't believe that you
Completely turned my world around

Don't you know
I'll pull a star from the sky for you
If you want me to
Say the word
And I will love you until a day
Last forever

This is straight from the heart
No one could ever doubt
(My love) My love will last till the end of time
Of time

Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this is straight from the heart
No one could ever doubt
(My love) My love will last till the end of time (Time)

Oh, this is straight from the heart
No one could ever doubt
(My love) My love will last till the end of time (Time) Oh...oh...

This is straight from the heart
No one could ever doubt
(My love) My love
