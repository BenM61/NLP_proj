"Tell Dr. Q everything from the start"

I gave you my number
Friday you would call
Friday in my bedroom
Staring lonely at my wall

Your eyes set me on fire
Your absence makes me cry
My heart is full of desire
Where are you tonight?

Insecurity
Why don't you give your love to me?
Insecurity
You're the only one who can set me free

When you come around
It's like a twenty-four hour cure
Gone today, here tomorrow
I am never sure

Your eyes set me on fire
Your absence makes me cry
My heart is full of desire
Where are you tonight?

Insecurity
Why don't you give your love to me?
Insecurity
You're the only one who can set me free
Insecurity
Why don't you give your love to me?
Insecurity
You're the only one, only one who can set me free

Your eyes set me on fire
Your absence makes me cry
My heart is full of desire
Where are you tonight?

Insecurity
Why don't you give your love to me?
Insecurity
You're the only one who can set me free
Insecurity
Why don't you give your love to me?
Insecurity
You're the only one who can set me free

Insecurity
Insecurity (insecure, insecurity)
Insecurity (insecure, insecurity)
Insecurity (insecure, insecurity)
*fade out*
