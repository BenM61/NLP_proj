Time 
Won't ease my memory 
It's killing me now
And Lord how I need him here 
Just to feel him near 
And hear him breathing
Still 
The night goes on and on 
Another lonely song I'm singing
Lord don't think bad of me 
Don't get mad at me you know I'm weak
And it couldn't cause a whole lot of harm 
To be in somebody's arms
Cause she's in his 
I know she is 
I know she is 
But God I love him
And though 
I shouldn't give a damn 
That's the way I am now
And Lord 
Guess I'll stay this way 
I can't play this way 
Just because I'm lonely
Still 
The night goes on and on 
Another lonely song I'm singing
Lord don't look down on me 
Don't frown on me 
Let's just keep talking
Another lonely song I'm singing
