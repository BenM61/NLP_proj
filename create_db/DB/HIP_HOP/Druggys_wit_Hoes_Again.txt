Comin' down off a pill, see what next we on
Bad little bitch in the driver's seat
F*ck them rappers, should be bumpin' me
Puff on your own, shit, I puff alone
Won't pass the weed, but I'll pass a bitch
Mastermind, the bitch stole my dick
Stuck me up, and didn't hit a lick
Retaliated, had to bust off quick
Uh, let me see

Leanin' like a motherfuckin' cholo, ho
Blue chucks on, El Pollo Loc'
Black lip bastard, O.G. Master
Off of E she climax faster
Spread her legs like mayonnaise
Been had game since Sega Saturn (Soul)
I won't pass the weed, but I'll pass your bitch
Would you relax a bit? I'm on activist
Them niggas thought I had a laxative
Now, ain't that some shit?
Hmm, ain't that some shit?
She suck dick, but she don't give me no lip
I run shit, but I don't be on no field
Bust on hoes, don't need no clip

Rollin' through the city with my gangsta bitch
I'm a gangsta, bitch! (Hiiipower)
We on y'all heels like anklets

[?] Hallway, blowed all day, carry on
She unzipped these 501 jeans, after that she told me
She told me

You nasty (you nasty) soul!

Bet she swallow dick
Bet she love my swag
