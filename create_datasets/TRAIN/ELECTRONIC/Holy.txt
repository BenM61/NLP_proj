Harmony always, when I look around me
And your smile I see,
I can feel it surround me.
A miracle I find in your company.
One glance is all that I need.
What I was searching for, I've found it.
Can you believe it, I'm walking on water
And I'm high off the ground.
Must be some mystique that weaves it.
I'd never have thought of this power I've found.
One glance is all that I need.
What I was searching for, I've found it.
One look, and now I believe
I could just wrap my whole self around it.
Holy, to me, just one glance is holy.
One touch of your heart, to me, that's holy.
Holy, to me, just one glance is holy.
One touch of your heart, to me, that's holy.
You've seen it, walking on water.
Miracles like you never seen before.
You've seen it, walking on water.
Miracles like you never seen before.
Holy, to me, just one glance is holy.
One touch of your heart, to me, that's holy.
Holy, to me, just one glance is holy.
One touch of your heart, to me, that's holy.
Holy, to me, just one glance is holy.
One touch of your heart, to me, that's holy.
Holy, to me, just one glance is holy.
One touch of your heart, to me, that's holy.
Holy, to me, just one glance is holy.
One touch of your heart, to me, that's holy.
Holy, to me, just one glance is holy.
One touch of your heart, to me, that's holy.
