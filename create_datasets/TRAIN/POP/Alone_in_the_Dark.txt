I told you to be discreet
But you enter the world and you broadcast me
Trust is something you can't see
But when it gets broken it cuts so deep

Hope you're feeling super chic
Since you made a joke out of me

Here you come walking down the street
With your fake sunshine
Pouring down on me
At least I can say I have a heart
'Cause you broke it in two
Now I'd rather be alone in the dark
Yeah, I'd rather be alone in the dark

Yesterday, we had no plans
Just a map of the world in our hands
Everything was you and me
Now we're drifting along, in a bitter sea

I can steer this boat on shore
'Cause there is no us anymore

Here you come walking down the street
With your fake sunshine
Pouring down on me
At least I can say I have a heart
'Cause you broke it in two
Now I'd rather be alone in the dark
Yeah, I'd rather be alone in the dark

But I'll get over you
If it's the last thing that I do
I'll get over you

Here you come walking down the street
With your fake sunshine
Pouring down on me
Now there's a hole where there was a heart
Oh, leave me alone
'Cause I'd rather be alone in the dark
Here you come walking down the street
With your neon smile
Flashing down on me
Now there's a hole where there was a heart
Oh, leave me alone
'Cause I'd rather be alone in the dark
Yeah, I'd rather be alone in the dark
Yeah, I'd rather be alone in the dark
'Cause I'm pretty happy here in the dark
