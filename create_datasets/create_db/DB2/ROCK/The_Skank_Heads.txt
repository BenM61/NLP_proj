You have seen me lie
You have seen me crucify respect
Seen redundant eyes
Seen the tension stagger to the mike

Made the bed too high
Have to slad on matey floors of sin
Slap the face, too sane
See the face, too wet as I deny myself, deny

Get off, get off me, get off, get off me
Get off, get off me, get off, get off me

Bet you're posing hard
So secure, a smacked up cuntie bitch
Now you're stuck for words
Scrambling for sarcastic wit

But I got that special knowledge
Of the crap that makes your skank head tick
All that brave you like, all that shirty pretense
You deny yourself, yourself, yourself, deny

Get off, get off me, get off, get off me
Get off, get off me, get off, get off me

Get off, get off, get off, get off

Get off, get off me, get off, get off me
Get off, get off me, get off, get off me, off
