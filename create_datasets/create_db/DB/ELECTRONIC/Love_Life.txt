Can I be the one
To share your love life
To share your love life

You live a life alone and so do I
Don't you ever get lonely and do you wonder why?
May I propose a new solution, a revolution for you and me?

Can I be the one to share your love life?

Why don't we share a place, the two of us?
Just a quiet life without much fuss
With our love we'll make the most of it
You must admit, you'll agree, ohh

I'm tall and presentable, well-dressed and clean
With a good sense of humor, non-smoking, non-scene
I like walks in the country, a film or a play
A couple of beers or a glass of Chardonnay
