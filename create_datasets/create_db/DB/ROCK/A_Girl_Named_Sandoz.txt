Well I met a girl called Sandoz
And she taught me many, many things
Good things, very good things, sweet things 
 
I met her one sunny morning
It was hot but the snow lay on the ground
Strange things, very strange things, my mind has wings 

Sandoz, Sandoz who taught me love
Sandoz, Sandoz heavens above
They could all learn something from your mind 
Yeah baby 
 
She is very old 
You may think she's young
One kiss from her 
And you know your time has come 

Good times, for all time, Sandoz
Sandoz
