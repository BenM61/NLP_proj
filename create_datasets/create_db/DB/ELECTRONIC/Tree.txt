In the end I disappear
moving from this house of fear
as the quiet thunder roar
I have passed the final door
walking further into darkness
trying hard to love the night
as the tunnel turns and twists
is there ever more than this?
Can we hope to leave the maze
minds enshrouded yet in haze
Seeing double all the time
in the end we share our mind
with the maker of this time
and the space that comes between
is no distance after all

Hey tree - won't you talk to me
I can see you breathing
open your eyes
all ready to see
greater revelation
from a mere tree
Come down
here's my silver cord.
Let me take you
to my veins, let you touch the sun
feel the sky

Trees loves us so talk to her
about love of life and sacrifice
mother mother love for all of us, yah
shower and flower
your sweet nurturing power
so that we can be and breathe
freely
