There's nothing for me here
I'm starting to get old
And time just ticks on
We've all been taking some
Comfort in repetition
But I'm left with no way to scratch
What has been itching

And I'm ready
And waiting
For the happy ending

Days go by they pass right through us
Our night lives make us so useless
Now we don't take anything to heart
We don't care and we don't want to start
Well I'm leaving for a while I'll head in some direction
I just don't know which one I should be taking and

I'm ready
And waiting
For the happy ending
I'm begging
And pleading
For another beating
I'm ready
And waiting
For the happy ending
