Ride me, ride you
We do anything we wanna do
Speed you, speed me, you're my machine
Daytona demon, Daytona demon
Daytona demon, Daytona demon
Ride up, ride down
Let your motor make me heaven bound
Hang in, hang on, turn me on
Daytona demon, Daytona demon
Daytona demon...wow

He's my Daytona demon
He's my souped up heavy hung he man
He's my D-d-daytona demon, my machine
He's my Daytona demon
He's my fast lovin' sin soaked heathen
He's my D-d-daytona demon, my machine

Feel good, oh feel free
And I know he always feels like me
He drives fast, drives hard, drives with me
Daytona demon, Daytona demon
Daytona demon, Daytona demon
And they love to see
My demon when he's driving me
Like a man made machine, he's so mean
Daytona demon, Daytona demon
Daytona demon...wow

He's my Daytona demon
He's my souped up heavy hung he man
He's my D-d-daytona demon, my machine
He's my Daytona demon
He's my fast lovin' sin soaked heathen
He's my D-d-daytona demon, my machine

Ride...ride...ride...ride
Daytona demon, Daytona demon
Daytona demon...wow

He's my Daytona demon...
