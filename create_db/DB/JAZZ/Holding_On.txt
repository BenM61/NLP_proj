Used to live in the danger zone
Any day it could get too rough
Now I'm glad I kept holding on
Now I'm glad I had soul enough

You turned night into day
And showed me how my soul could sing
You took my hurt away
And showed me love conquers anything

When two hearts both feel the same
There's a way to beat the game

Holding on now I'm standing in the light
Holding on and this time I"ll get it right
Holding on every day and every night
Holding on

Fall asleep in your lover's arms
And it's just like it ought to be
Just be thankful she keeps you warm
In a world where there's nothing free

Give her love every day
And pay attention when she dreams
And she'll be good to you
Cause sometimes love is just what it seems

When two hearts both feel the same
There's a way to beat the game

Holding on now I'm standing in the light
Holding on and this time I'll get it right
Holding on every day and every night
Holding on

See the mountain water keep flowing down
Into streams
Now it holds on forever
We'll be holding on forever

People should searching all night long
For a reason to help them live
And I do hope they hear the song
Get through take and you get to give

It can be in a smile
It can be there in a touch
It warms the world a while
When it's love it can't be too much
