There was light 
And atomic fission 
Swelling wind and 
Rising ash 
Tide of black rain 
Cement seared shadow traces 
Reminiscent of their 
Last commands 

Instantly one thousand 
Flames arising 
Ill scent of 
Burning hides surrounding 
A settlement 
Debased entirely 

Enola Gay had made a casual delivery 

Please build a future darling 
With our bomb 
Cherish and love it 
For the sake of 
Earth bound kingdom come 

The undersides of 
Fallen metal trusses 
Evil debris of 
Human bodies 
Each window's glass 
Shards pelted 
Secure confines 
Brittle collapse 
Neighbors lay beside 
Each other unknowing 
Faces scorched 
Of all familiar bearing 
Too few hands 
Wounds for closing 
Marred by thirsting 
Anguish 
Fear 
Lamenting 

Here we stand 
At the door to 
Gold Atomic Age 
Don't spoil your faces with worry 
Trust in earth bound kingdom come
