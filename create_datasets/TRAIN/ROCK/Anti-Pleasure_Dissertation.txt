Maybe I like you
Maybe I do
Oooo, oooo, oooo

Maybe I felt something real for just a moment
Was I wrong to trust anyone?
Tell me, tell me

Did you tell them everything I said?
Did you tell them everything?
Did you tell them everything I said?
Did you tell them everything I said?
Why don't you tell them?

Did you get a good laugh?
Tell me, was it good?
Was it good?
Was it good for you?
Did you win that race?
Did you score that point?
Are you so fucking cool, fucking cool now?
Did ya, did ya, did ya, did ya, did ya, did ya
Did ya, did ya, did ya, did ya, did ya?

Go tell your fucking friends
What I saw and how I felt
How punk fucking rock my pussy smelled
Why don't you tell them?

I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
Honey, baby, this I know

Maybe I like you
Maybe I do
