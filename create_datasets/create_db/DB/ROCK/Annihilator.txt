The storm is coming closer
Spreading out, infecting like disease (like a disease)
All life below, is crushed under the power of machine

Lightning rips the sky at night
His power paints the city blood red (blood red)
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Don't look behind cause you're dead

Annihilator (now you're dead) Annihilator
Annihilator (now you're dead) Annihilator

You're trapped alone, filled with fear
There's no one to help you
The storm is coming closer
Spreading out, infecting like disease (like a disease)
All life below is crushed under the power of machine

Annihilator (this machine) Annihilator
