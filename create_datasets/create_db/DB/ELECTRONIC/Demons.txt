Well hello old friend
The night is dark, and I feel cold
The sun is setting
I need to get out before it starts

I can feel it and I know it's not the same
I'm the the wound; you're the drug to ease my pain
I was wondering if you'll ever see me again

I keep running and I don't know why
I see my demons and I just can't hide
Say no! I wanna let go!

I keep running and I don't know why
I see my demons and I just can't hide
Say no! I wanna let go!

Your voice is fading
A distant sound, a silent call
It keeps me waiting
The one to catch me if I fall

I can feel it and it's not the same
I'm the wound; you're the drug to ease my pain
I was wondering if you'll ever see me again

I keep running and I don't know why
I see my demons and I just can't hide
Say no! I wanna let go!

I keep running and I don't know why
I see my demons and I just can't hide
Say no! I wanna let go!

When there is so much at stake
Tell me is this real or is this fake
I'm circling around this room

I keep running and I don't know why
I see my demons and I just can't hide
Say no! I wanna let go!
