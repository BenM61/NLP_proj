Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond, beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return

And it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done

This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you

The white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through

We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You
