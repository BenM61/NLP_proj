You're on your ear, the ocean's near.
The light has started to fade.
Your high is timed,
You found the climb

It's hard to focus on more than what's
In front of you, electron blue.
Adventure rings with a page.
And when,

It dawns on you, it singes blue,
Your buzz beginning to wane.

Adventure has laid its claim on you
It's all you want to do
You, you know where to run
You run electron blue.

And who am I?
I'm just a guy.
I've got a story like everyone

But in your eyes,
You looked surprised.
And didn't know where to run.

I looked to her
She's found the cure
Her future's already begun.

Tomorrow is gaining speed on you
It's all you want to do
You, you know where to run
You run electron blue.

You, you know where to run
You run electron blue.

So bide your time
You'll feel the climb
Your high it builds like a lightning storm

It sings like pearls
You know that girl
And no one is any the wiser so

As if on cue
Electron blue
Tomorrow is gaining speed on you
It's all you want to do
You, you know where to run
You run electron blue.

You, you know where to run
You run electron blue.

You, you know where to run
You run electron blue.
