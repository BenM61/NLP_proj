You know you want me

They say that you been
Watchin' me boy

By the way you're talkin'
That you're really tryin'
To get to me, boy

Not anyone I'll just let in my heart
You have to be hungry for me
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
What makes me think that I can say this to you
I know how bad you want this

If you want my future then
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no

By the time I'm through with you
You'll be beggin' me for more

Your whole story
Because you're fine and
And you know it
You think
That you can have me
Just listen closely
No, it ain't so easy
Every word
You've said I have heard before

Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
One thing I've been told
Nothin' else compares
To this lovin' body

If you want my future then
You better work it, boy

So you want my lovin, no

Nice and easy
