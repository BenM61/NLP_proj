It's my own fault, I don't blame you for treating me the way you do 
 It's my own fault, I don't blame you for treating me the way you do 
 When you was deep in love with me, at that time, little girl, I didn't love you 
 You used to make your paycheck and then bring it all home to me 
 You know I would go up on the corner, make every woman drunk I see 
 That's my own fault. honey, I don't blame you for treating me the way you do 
 When you was deep in love with me, at that time, little girl, I didn't love you 
 You know I used to take you out, little girl, and keep you weeks after weeks 
 You were so scared to quit me, little darling, I may make a 'fore day creep 
 That's my own fault, girl, honey, I don't blame you for treating me the way you do 
 When you was deep in love with me, at that time, little girl, I wouldn't be true 
 (Tell her everything, man
