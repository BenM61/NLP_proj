Girl, I know he ain't takin' care of you
I see it in your face
And I know that's not the man that you really want
You know

So if you're getting sick and tired of him,
Just come see me
I'm a better man any way.

Lies and deceit
I know you feel this with your man
'Cause with him, all I see is crying

[Chorus]
I should be your boyfriend (I should be your boyfriend)
'Cause you know he's lyin' ('Cause you know he's lyin')
It might seem like I'm hating (Might seem like I'm hating)
But girl, I'm just relating

Step one, walk through that door
Step two, tell him
He's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore

Now three, come to me
Step four, I'll love you more
You will see how love should be
But there's four steps to complete

There was a time
When he tried to be the one
Who would give all you deserve
Now he's not trying

[Chorus]

Step one, walk through that door
Step two, tell him
He's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore

Now three, come to me
Step four, I'll love you more
You will see how love should be
But there's four steps to complete

[Chorus]
Step one, walk through that door
Step two, tell him
He's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore

Now three, come to me
Step four, I'll love you more
You will see how love should be (You're gonna see baby)
But there's four steps to complete
 
You're what I'm lookin' for
Our love will mean much more
Than what he's givin' you
But you must let him know
That you can't take no more
Replace him with me

You need to learn how to show that feeling, (That feeling)
To someone who deserves it.
You can't figure out, what it's all about
Baby (Baby)

[Chorus]

Step one, walk through that door
Step two, tell him
He's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore

Now three, come to me
Step four, I'll love you more
You will see how love should be
But there's four steps to complete

[Chorus]

Step one, walk through that door
Step two, tell him
He's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore

Now three, come to me
Step four, I'll love you more
You will see how love should be
But there's four steps to complete
