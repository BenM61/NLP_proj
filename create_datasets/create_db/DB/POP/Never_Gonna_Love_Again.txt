Baby can you hear the rain fall on me
Never gonna love again
Baby can you hear my heart cry tonight
I can't keep running away
This time
I can't keep running away,
'Cause I'm never gonna love again

Every time the rain falls, think of me
On a lonely highway
How can we
Turn around the heartache
Oh I, I'm alone tonight babe
And I'm never gonna love again

Baby wait a lifetime before
You love somebody new
Come and turn the lights down so I
Can feel your hand in mine
Can we
Start all over again cause
I'm never gonna love a new

Every time the rain falls, think of me
On a lonely highway
How can we
Turn around the heartache
Oh I, I'm alone tonight babe
And I'm never gonna love again

Never gonna love again, no not I,
Not I, I'm never gonna love again

Never gonna love again, no not I,
Not I, I'm never gonna love again

Drive me to the dead end, till I
Promise not to run
This time
I can't keep running away cause
I'm never gonna love again.

Every time the rain falls, think of me
On a lonely highway
How can we
Turn around the heartache
Oh I, I'm alone tonight babe
And I'm never gonna love again

Never gonna love again, no not I,
Not I, I'm never gonna love again

Never gonna love again, no not I,
Not I, I'm never gonna love again
