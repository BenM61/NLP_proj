You take your time to come back this time
The grass has grown under your feet
In your absence I changed my mind
And someone else is sitting in your seat

I know that I said that there'd be no-one else, no
I know that I said I'd be true
But baby, I burned Cupid's arrow
And here's the short and narrow
I've nothing left to offer you

'Cause I'm

All cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
A handful of nothing
All cried out
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving
All cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
A handful of nothing
All cried out
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving me around

So don't look surprised there was no disguise
You knew where I stood from the start
So stop (Stop) look around you
You're right back where I found you
Take back your cold and empty heart 

All cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
a handful of nothing
All cried out
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving me around (All cried out)
All cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
a handful of nothing
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving me around

You go your way
I'll go mine
I won't stay around here
Don't you waste my time

All cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
A handful of nothing
All cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
A handful of nothing 
All cried out
All cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
A handful of nothing

All cried out
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving me around(all cried out)
