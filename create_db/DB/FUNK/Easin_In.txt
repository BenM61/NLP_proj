Easin' in, slick as he can
He's easin' in, easin' in

Easin' in, slick as he can
He's easin' in, easin' in

There's a man comin' into town
He don't wanna know that he'll be around
So he's easin' in

Easin' in, easin' in

Like a cat that's stalking it prey
He don't wanna let it get away

Easin' in, easin' in

Easin' in, slick as he can
He's easin' in, easin' in

He's easin' in the city
He's dangerous sly and shifty
If he should happen to write your name down
Don't you try to fly outta town!

Ya see, he's slick
And he can't be tricked
He ain't never made a mark
He could not hit, ow!

Easin' in, slick as he can
He's easin' in, easin' in

Easin' in, slick as he can
He's easin' in, easin' in

Easin' in, ooh he's easin' in

Easin' in, slick as he can
He's easin' in, easin' in

Easin' in, slick as he can
He's easin' in, easin' in

Easin' in, slick as he can
He's easin' in, easin' in
