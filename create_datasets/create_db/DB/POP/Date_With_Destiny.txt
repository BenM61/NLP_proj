(Greedy Smith)
I got a date with a girl called Destiny
She's real smart and sweet
Me loving her was always meant to be
To make my life complete
I can't avoid fate or a girl
I can't avoid fate or a girl called Destiny
I'm goin' to try and win her love tonight
I hope I'm good enough
Dressed in my best threads I hope I look alright
I usually look pretty rough
Can't avoid fate or a girl
Can't avoid fate or a girl
Can't avoid fate or a girl called Destiny
Seems to me
It's got to be
Seems to me
It's got to be - Destiny
