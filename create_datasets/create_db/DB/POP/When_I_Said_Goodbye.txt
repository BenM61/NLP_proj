I said too much, went way too far 
It's only now, now we're apart 
That I can see I was wrong 
And you're where I belong 
So please don't make me cry 
I know you don't believe it, 
But I really didn't mean it 
When I said goodbye. 

(When I said goodbye) 

I was a fool, now I'm alone 
Would you have stayed, 
Stayed if you had known 
That every thought is of you 
Hurt is all I can do 
Without you in my life. 

I know you don't believe it 
But I really didn't mean it 
When I said goodbye 

I can't bear to watch you fly, 
I need you in my life 
Don't say goodbye 
Let's give love another chance 
It used to be that you and me 
Was all we needed to know 
I can't believe you're leaving 
And I can't live my life alone 

We've changed so much 
And still love remains 
Let's work it out, 
There's no need to turn the page 
You're love is everything 
Don't let go, we can win 
If we would only try 

I know you don't believe it 
But I really didn't mean it 
When I said goodbye 

(Goodbye) 

(When I said goodbye)
