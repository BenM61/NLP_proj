Nothing could compare to your love
I wake up feeling good everyday
I used to have a problem with love
Until you re-directed my way

Faithfully
You love me
You're just what I need
Please don't change
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully

Some say love is just a word
But I know what it really means
A future and stability is what
That is what you've given to me

Even though we've had many arguments
This is stronger than any love has ever been
Baby through it all you've been there for me
And I love you just because you love faithfully

Faithfully
You love me
You're just what I need
Please don't change
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully

Faithfully
You love me
You're just what I need
Please don't change
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully

Don't ever change
I just want you the same
If you take your love away
I don't ever want to here about you not being in my life
Because you love me so faithfully

Faithfully
You love me
You're just what I need
Please don't change
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully

Faithfully
You love me
You're just what I need
Please don't change
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully

Faithfully
You love me
You're just what I need
Please don't change
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully

Faithfully
You love me
You're just what I need
Please don't change
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully
