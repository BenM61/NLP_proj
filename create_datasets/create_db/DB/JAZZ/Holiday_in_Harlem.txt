Music music everywhere
Happiness is in the air
Not a soul has got a care
Holiday in Harlem

Up and down the avenue
You see faces old and new
With a smile that welcomes you
'Cause it's holiday in Harlem

Sophisticated ladies
Dizzy, dumb, and wise
My oh my, when they get high
There's danger in their eyes

Not a soul is feelin' blue
Up and down the avenue
With a smile that welcomes you
Holiday in Harlem

Sophisticated ladies
Dizzy, dumb, and wise
My oh my, when they get high
There's danger in their eyes

Not a soul is feelin' blue
Up and down the avenue
With a smile that welcomes you
'Cause it's holiday in Harlem
