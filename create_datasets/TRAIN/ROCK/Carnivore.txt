All my life they let me know
How far I would not go
But inside the beast still grows
Chewing through the ropes

Who are you to change this world?
Silly boy!
No one needs to hear your words.
Let it go.

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am.
Bring it to an end.
Carnivore! Carnivore!
Could you come and change me?
Take away everything I am.
Everything I am.

I will hide myself below
I'll be what you wanted
Kept inside I won't let go
'Till I burn beyond control

Who are you to change this world?
Silly boy!
No one needs to hear your words.
Let it go.

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am.
Bring it to an end.
Make me fall. Make me bleed.
Go ahead and change me?
Take away everything I am.
Everything I am.

Never enough
(Who I am is not good enough)
Never enough
(Who I am)

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am.
Bring it to an end.
Carnivore! Carnivore!
Could you come and change me?
Take away everything I am.
Everything I am. (am, am, am, am)
