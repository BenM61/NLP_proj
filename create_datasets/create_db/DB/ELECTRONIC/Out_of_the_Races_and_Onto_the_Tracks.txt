Get yourself together 
Get yourself together 
Shake shake shake shake shake 
Shake shake shake 
Shake shake shake 
Shake 

Get yourself together 
Take it all on chair 
Get yourself together 
Mothers in a lawn chair 
Electric come to get in 
Verbal litigation 
Out of the races and in to the track 
Punishment in higher places 
People they are weird 

And people they act strange 
Get yourself together 
Shake shake shake shake 
Shake shake shake shake 
People they are weird 
And take yourself for rent 
All I see is all I see is all I see is 
Punishment in higher places
