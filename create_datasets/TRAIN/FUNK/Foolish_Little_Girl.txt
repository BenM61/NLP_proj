You broke his heart and made him cry,
And he's been blue since then.
Now he's found somebody new, 
And you want him back again.
 
Foolish Little Girl, fickle little girl.
You didn't want him when he wanted you.
He's found another love, It's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do.
 
But I love him.
No you don't it's just your pride that's hurt.
I still love him.
If you got him back again,
You'd go right out and do him dirt.
 
Foolish Little Girl, fickle little girl.
You didn't want him when he wanted you.
He's found another love, It's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do.
Forget him 'cause he don't belong to you.
 
Foolish Little Girl, fickle little girl.
You didn't want him when he wanted you.
He's found another love, It's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do.
 
But I love him.
It's to late to have a change of heart.
I still love him.
Tomorrow is his wedding day,
And you'll keep quiet if you're smart.
 
Foolish Little Girl, fickle little girl.
You didn't want him when he wanted you.
He's found another love, It's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do.
Forget him 'cause he don't belong to you.
Forget him 'cause he don't belong to you.
Forget him 'cause he don't belong to you.
