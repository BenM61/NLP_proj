Couldn't get to sleep last night
Missing you so much, it hurts
Missing your company
All the things you mean to me, girl

Baby, won't you please come home
Baby, won't you please come home
Baby, won't you please come home to me

Don't have very much to say
Never was so good with words
It's only that I'm missing you
Wishing I was kissing you now

Baby, won't you please come home
Baby, won't you please come home
Baby, won't you please come home to me

Baby, won't you please come home
Baby, won't you please come home
Baby, won't you please come home to me

Baby, won't you please come home
Baby, won't you please come home
Baby, won't you please come home to me
