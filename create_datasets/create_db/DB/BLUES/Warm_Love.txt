I want to beat off your advances
But know that you are winning
Water for your thirst
Your fuel
To burn
Let me be
Your night potion
Your one
Romeo
Let me feed that keen appetite

Warm love
Warm love
I'll give you
Kisses in the morning
Your starter for the night

I want to sit right down beside you
With one thought inside my head
Longing for love
Little darling
Love that won't give up
Let me be the reason
For lonely sleepless nights
Let me feed that keen appetite

Oh when I hold you in my arms
I am the victim
Oh when I hold you in my arms
I can feel you
I can feel you
Taking effect

Warm love
Good lasting love
I'll give you
Kisses in the morning
Your starter for the night
