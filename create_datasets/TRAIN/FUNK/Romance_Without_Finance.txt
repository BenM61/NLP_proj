No I'm not the type of girl to say
Baby, if you wanna play you pay
No way, I'm not that kind
Oh yeah, I've got love on my mind
Down in the quarter
Out on the corner, walkin' the line
They say romance without finance
That's a crime

Mercy me, heavens above!
What's money got to do with love?
I need a squeeze without a doubt
Won't put my hold on your bank account
I need a lover
Under the cover of the night
And if it's romance without finance
That's all right

Let us give you some free advice
Say that love must have its price
Can't you see girl, you're wastin' your time
That boy, he ain't got a dime

They don't know if your love is true
They don't see what I see in you
You got a touch, feelin' so fine
I don't care about your bottom line

Down in the quarter
Almighty dollar's on their minds
But I'll take romance over finance
Every time

I don't care what your daddy do
I don't care if your blood is blue
Legal tender's bringin' me down
It ain't what makes my world go round

I need a lover
Seens me some tender eyes that shine
I'll take my romance over finance
Every time

Romance without finance
And I'll take romance over finance
Every time
