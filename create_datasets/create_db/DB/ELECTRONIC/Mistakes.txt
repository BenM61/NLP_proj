I should probably leave, right?
You got me buzzin' like a street light
And I've been trying to put it behind
But can't deny we got a real vibe
We're doing something I can't explain now
Putting pictures on my brain now
But really I should get some me time
'Fore I do something I can't rewind

Oh baby, gimme highs and lows
Wanna get close, no clothes
I don't feel like going home now
Got me all up in the zone now
Oh baby, gimme highs and lows
Wanna get close, no clothes
Probably better if I go now

You make me, you make me, you make me wanna make mistakes
Love how bittersweet it tastes
Hey, hey, hey
You make me, you make me, you make me wanna make mistakes
Bend my heart until it breaks
Hey, hey, hey

You say a lot in between lines
It's in the air like real high
You make it really hard to leave, I
Know I'm gonna want to get out of my Levi's
You're doing something I can't explain
Putting pictures on my brain
And really I should get some me time
But in the meantime, some you and me time

Oh baby, gimme highs and lows
Wanna get close, no clothes
I don't feel like going home now
Got me all up in the zone now
Oh baby, gimme highs and lows
Mixin' up do's and dont's
Probably better if I go now

You make me, you make me, you make me wanna make mistakes
Love how bittersweet it tastes
Hey, hey, hey
You make me, you make me, you make me wanna make mistakes
Bend my heart until it breaks
Hey, hey, hey
You make me, you make me, you make me wanna make mistakes
Love how bittersweet it tastes

I've been trying to take it slow
But you're making it impossible
I don't wanna think it through
I just wanna with you, ooh, hmm
Hey, hey, hey

You make me, you make me, you make me wanna make mistakes
Love how bittersweet it tastes (it tastes like)
Hey hey hey
You make me, you make me, you make me wanna make mistakes
Bend my heart until it breaks
Hey, hey, hey
You make me, you make me, you make me wanna make mistakes
Love how bittersweet it tastes (it tastes like)
Hey, hey, hey
You make me, you make me, you make me wanna make mistakes
Bend my heart until it breaks
Hey, hey, hey
