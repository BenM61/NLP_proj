Where ever you go, where ever you may wander in your life
Surely you know I always want to be there
Holding your hand and standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you thru in ev'rything you do

Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Watching you grow and going thru the changes in your life
That's how I know I'll always want to be there
Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on, here I am
Whenever you call, you know I'll be there

Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
All I ask you is let me be there
