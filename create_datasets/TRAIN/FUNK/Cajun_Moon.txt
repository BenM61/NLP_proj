Cajun moon
Where does your power lie
As you move
Across the southern sky
You took my babe 
Way too soon
What have you done
Cajun moon

Someday babe
When you want your man
And you find him gone
Just like the wind
Don't trouble your mind 
Whatever you do
'Cause Cajun moon 
Took him from you

Cajun moon
Where does your power lie
As you move
Across the southern sky
You took my babe 
Way too soon
What have you done
Cajun moon

When daylight fades
The night comes on
You can hear the silence
Of this song
Don't trouble your mind
Whatever you do
'Cause he got me 
Like he got you

Cajun moon
Where does your power lie
As you move
Across the southern sky
You took my babe 
Way too soon
What have you done
Cajun moon
