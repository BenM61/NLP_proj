Father stop
Criticizing your son
Mother please
Leave your daughters alone
Don't you see that's what wrong
With the world with world today
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

We all talk about kindness
But it's only only a word
Brother turned on a sister
In this cruel cruel world today
That's what's wrong
With all in this world today
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Somebody to play with
Wanna to mold you, wanna mold you
Shape it like they wanna
Wanna to do their thing

Children are told
To give not just to take
If we were all children
You know the world
Will be a better place
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
We should all love each other
Love and take one another
We should love each other
Love and not hate, oh

Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
True everybody wants somebody
To mold them, shape them own way
Everybody wants somebody
Try to make it
Or do their, do their thing
Everybody wants to take somebody
Got to make it do their thing
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
