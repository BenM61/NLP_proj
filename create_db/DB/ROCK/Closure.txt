Breathe, trust, bless me,
And release,
Climb hard, or never be seen,
Closed off, rescue to breathe,
Just bless me.

Too sided time,
Your rebirth can't hurt,
Branch out behind,
The pain.

Closure has come to me,
Myself,
You will never belong,
To me.

Closure has come to me,
Myself,
You will never belong,
To me!

Had to turn,
And lay down,
You're the sting of disease,
Phase you out,
Should've seen this coming,
Go on,
Confusing this soul,
Hold my breath,
Til you rupture!

Three days aside,
Your rebirth can't hurt,
Branch out behind,
Pride.

Closure has come to me,
Myself,
You will never belong,
To me.

Closure has come to me,
Myself,
You will never belong,
To me!

Like a leech,
I hold on,
As if we belonged,
To some,
Precious pure dream,
Cast off,
You've seen what's beneath,
Now fail me!

Forget closure,
Forget closure,
Forget closure,
Forget closure!

Closure has come to me,
Myself,
You will never belong,
To me!

Closure has come to me,
Myself,
You will never belong,
To me!

Go!
