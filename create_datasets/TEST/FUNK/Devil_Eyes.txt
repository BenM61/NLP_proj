Sweet is her talk and she smiles like a beauty queen
And she's got everything that makes a man start to dream
When I'm not with you she's trying to tear us apart
Don't let her catch you she's only breaking your heart
She's an angel
Angel with devil eyes
Leave that angel
Angel and get wise
For she's got uh hu hu hu devil eyes
Yeah
She's got uh hu hu hu devil eyes
Sweet is her kiss and it's turning your head around
And you don't think of me and of the true love we've found
You'll hear her whisper tenderly calling your name
But never trust her she's only playing her game
She's an angel
Angel with devil eyes

Sweet is her talk but every word's a lie
And you don't realize she's the spider and you're the fly
You don't remember the promises you gave to me
When it's too late dear all of a sudden you'll see
She's an angel
Angel with devil eyes
