Things have changed this time around
I'm on the rocks and looking down
And I can't see for all the darkness 'round here.

You're in Spain and you're walking free
I'm inside without the key
Feeling sick and angry towards you.

Locked away, I'm going mad
I'm a fool, I'm so sad, 
I'm a fool, I've been had.

We planned a job
And you let me down
You made a run
I hit the ground
Can't trust nobody
Nobody no more.

No more, no
You're in Spain and you're walking free
I'm inside without the key
Feeling sick, sick and angry.

Locked away, I'm going mad
I'm a fool, I'm so sad
I'm a fool, I've been had.

Things have changed this time around
I'm on the rocks and looking down
I can't see for all the darkness 'round here.
