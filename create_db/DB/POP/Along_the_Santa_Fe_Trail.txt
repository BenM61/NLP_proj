Angels, come to paint the desert nightly,
When the moon is beaming brightly, 
Along the Santa Fe trail,
Stardust scattered all along the highway,on a rainbow colored skyway,
Along the Santa Fe trail,
Beside you, I'm riding every hill and dale,
While shadows hide me, just like a pretty purple veil,
Thereby hangs a tale,I found you and the mountains that surround you, are the walls I built around you. 
Along the Santa Fe trail.
