Fascination with the light in your hair 
A celebration, nothing else can compare 
An invitation to share my life with you 

Stepping forward, reaching out for your hand 
Hear the music of the sea on the sand 
Like a vision rising out of the blue 

Looking like a 
Young moon in the heavens 
Mother to the stars 
Young moon guide us tonight 

Elevation to a place high above 
The combination, you and me and our love 
Determination to spend my life with you 

Looking at you face to face with my world 
A quiet beauty not like just any girl 
Moving slowly from the dark into view 

Looking like a 
Young moon in the heavens 
Mother to the stars 
Young moon guide us tonight 
We are here in this moment 
Shining twice as bright 
We are here for you to see 

Bright lights, long shadows 
Tonight, we can handle 
All of the doubts we may hold inside 
It is a new day, things are different now 
We've got each other 
We'll keep looking for that young moon 

We are here in this moment 
Shining twice as bright 
We are here for all to see 

Young moon in the heavens 
Mother to the stars 
Young moon guide us tonight 

We are here in this moment 
Shining twice as bright ...
