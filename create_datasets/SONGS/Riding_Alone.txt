I'm riding in the desert 
And I'm heading into nowhere 
The sun is showing me the way, 
I'm riding alone 
I'm looking for adventure, 
'Cause I left my girl in Texas 
I'm a stranger and I'm riding alone 

I'm riding in the desert 
And I'm heading into nowhere 
The sun is showing me the way, 
I'm riding alone 
I'm looking for adventure, 
'Cause I left my girl in Texas 
I'm a stranger and I'm riding alone 
(woo-hoo!) 

My baby's on his way 
And he's got nowhere to stay 
And I wonder what he's thinking on his own 
He's promised me his heart 
And he says he really loves me 
And I'll marry him as soon he's 
Coming home 

I'm riding in the desert 
And I'm heading into nowhere 
The sun is showing me the way, 
I'm riding alone 
I'm looking for adventure, 
'Cause I left my girl in Texas 
I'm a stranger and I'm riding alone 

Working as a waitress, 
The saloon is never empty 
I got so many suitors all around 
Although some are very handsome, 
They will never get my hand 
Because I'm waiting for my cowboy 
To come home (woo-hoo!) 

Woo-hoo! 
Woo-hoo! 
Wooo! 

I'm riding in the desert 
And I'm heading into nowhere 
The sun is showing me the way, 
I'm riding alone 
I'm looking for adventure, 
'Cause I left my girl in Texas 
I'm a stranger and I'm riding alone 

Woo-hoo! 
Hey, hey, hey 

He's riding in the desert 
And he's heading into nowhere 
The sun is showing him the way, 
He's riding alone 
He's looking for adventure, 
'Cause he's left his girl in Texas 
He's a stranger and he's riding alone 

I'm riding in the desert 
And I'm heading into nowhere 
The sun is showing me the way, 
I'm riding alone 
I'm looking for adventure, 
'Cause I left my girl in Texas 
I'm a stranger and I'm riding alone
