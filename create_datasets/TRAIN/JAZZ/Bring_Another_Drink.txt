Last night we had a party
With some mellow chicks,
At the gin mill down the street,
Just to get some kicks.

we sat down at the table,
The cover was a deuce,
The bad was swingin', in the mood,
"Bring us all some juice!".

We started lushin', the chicks got high,
But they weren't high enough,
'Cause we whispered love words in their ears,
The chicks got rough,
Awful stuff!

So let this be a lesson,
You better stop and think,
Before you whisper in her ear,
Bring another drink!
