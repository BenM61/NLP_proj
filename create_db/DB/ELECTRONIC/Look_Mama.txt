Honey, I think Audrey's a little mature for you 
No I don't think she's mature I think she's nice
Hey mom when are we going
Look mama I Love you
But you gotta let me live my life
Look mama I Love you 
But you gotta let me live my life

Don't wrap me up in cotton wool
You can't treat me like a fool
Anyway if I was, you gotta let me be one
OK give me your advice
It's not my fault if I can't be wise
Show me a person who hasn't been done

Look mama I Love you
But you gotta let me live my life
Look mama I Love you
But you gotta let me live my life

Don't try to stick your rules on me
I wasn't born as a carbon copy
I came out of you
But don't think that you own me
I have my respect for you
I won't try to change the things you do
Give me a break
Let me learn it my way
You think you know more than me
Experience hasn't set you free

Look mama I Love you
Look mama, look, look mama, look
Look mama I Love you
Loom mama, look, look mama, look

I gotta make my own mistakes
Why can't you treat me like a friend

Look mama I Love you 
But you gotta let me live my life
Look mama I Love you
But you gotta let me live my life

Look mama I Love you
Look mama, look, look mama, look
Look mama, look
