Wanna be here tonight
Wanna hide in your light
Wanna cover my eyes, I feel you reflect in me
I worship all that you see

Can I still make it right?
Can I be what you like?
Can I keep up this fight?
I hope that you'll never know
Why I need your control

(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
You're all I need to survive
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
Blind devotion
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
And you'll be my sacrifice
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
You say you love

I worship, high praises
My longing drives me crazy for you
My kingdom for your graces
I'm not gonna tell nobody
I'm not gonna tell nobody 'bout you
I'm not gonna tell nobody 'bout you

Gotta hold my head up
Gotta move for your touch
Gotta keep my lips shut
I'll do what you tell me to
'Cause in darkness I follow you
I follow you

(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
You're all I need to survive
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
Blind devotion
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
And you'll be my sacrifice
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
You say you love

I worship, high praises
My longing drives me crazy for you
My kingdom for your graces
I'm not gonna tell nobody
I'm not gonna tell nobody 'bout you

Just tell me how I can prove
I'm the one for your fire
And I'll take you higher
I'll do it for you
And you can worship me too

(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
(I'm holy, I want you to know it)
(I'm holy, I want you to know it) 

I worship, high praises
My longing drives me crazy for you
My kingdom for your graces
I'm not gonna tell nobody
I'm not gonna tell nobody 'bout you

I worship, high praises
My longing drives me crazy for you
My kingdom for your graces
I'm not gonna tell nobody
I'm not gonna tell nobody 'bout you
I'm not gonna tell nobody 'bout you
