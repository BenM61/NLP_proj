Suddenly, we were left
Without the worry of tomorrow
And comets fell from the sky
I took your breath, you took my sorrow

You walked sad in a dream
But count your days, boy, they are fading
You set a fire in my heart
One chance in a lifetime was worth the waiting

Let us go easy as we watch them hit the ground
When the light is gone, the memory of nothings left to sound
Memories, sweet whispers are all that we'll have left
So fall into these arms tonight and share this one last breath

Bring on the comets
Bring on the comets
Bring on the comets
Bring on, bring on
Bring on, bring on
