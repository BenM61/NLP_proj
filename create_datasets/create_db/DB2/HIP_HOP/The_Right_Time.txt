Yo, this is funky
Stevie J (Yeah) this is funky (Word)
Cherrelle, come on 
Keith kicks the rhyme at the right time
In a black jeep with Cherrelle in the drivers seat
Socializin, dip-dip divin
Noddin to a phat Stevie J beat
Master of disaster, you came to me
We treat the Benz just like a hooptie
We bring noise and the funk with the chalk and the skunk
With the double pump in the trunk
Learn a lesson, we make it hot
I'm not a player hater, yo, I just dis a lot
Cherrelle

What am I to say what I gotta do
To let you know my heart is calling out for you
Gotta find the right time
can't deny that I need you in my life

Been knowing you for awhile now
Always said I had to have you somehow
I'm just a woman who knows what she needs
If you're down, come take a chance with me, ho, ho...

What am I to say (Say) what I gotta do (Do)
To let you know my heart is calling out for you (Oh)
Gotta find (Gotta find ) the right time (Right time)
can't deny that I need you in my life

I want a man just to love me
I take care of myself, I don't need to help
don't wait for my to get down on my knees
I won't beg, don't plead, just tell me where to start, I need

I know that you're afraid of getting caught up in romance
But my love is calling, give me a chance (Give me a chance)
you're all I really love 
And I'm yearning for your love

What am I to say (Mmm) what I gotta do
To let you know my heart is calling out for you
Gotta find (Gotta find ) the right time (Right time)
can't deny that I need you in my life (What I got to say)

What am I to say (What I gotta do) what I gotta do
To let you know my heart is calling out for you
Gotta find the right time
can't deny that
