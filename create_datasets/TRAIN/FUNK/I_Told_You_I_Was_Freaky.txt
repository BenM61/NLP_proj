Girl, I'm gonna take the month of August off
Just to get you off
I'm freaky
I'm gonna clear the table top
We're gonna need a mop
I'm freaky

Let's take a photo of a goat in a boat
And then we can float in a moat and be freaky
Freak-ay

Let's take my body and we'll cover it with honey
Stick some money to the honey
Now I'm covered in money, honey

I go outside onto the ledge and push my ass against the glass
You can act like you don't know me

I'll take a cup and then I'll put it on my head
And I'll just stand there bein' freaky with a cup on my head

I told you I was freaky (I told you I was freaky, baby)
You didn't believe me (Don't look at me)
I told you I was freaky (Hey look at me)
Girl, let's get freaky

Let's make two life size cardboard cut outs of our bodies
And then pose them into sensual positions

I'll paint the wallpaper pattern onto your naked skin
Stand against the wallpaper and get up like chameleons

I flip some clips on my lips
I clip some chips to your hips
I nibble chips off your hips
And watch the moon eclipse

I'll go outside and get some leaves and pretend to be a tree
You can be a squirrel and store my nuts for me

I told you I was freaky (He told you he was freaky, baby)
You didn't believe me (Take that off)
I told you I was freaky (Put this on)
Girl, I do this shit weekly

Let's steal my roommate's pillow feathers
And make some homemade wings
Gonna fly so high with makeshift pillow wings
Girl, can you believe we're flyin' with homemade pillow wings
Ahhh

Oww ow
Oww ow oww

I told you I was freaky, baby
I told you I was freaky, baby
