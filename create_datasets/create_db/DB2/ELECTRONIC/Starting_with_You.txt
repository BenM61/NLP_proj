Look at you
Different day but same damn bags
You're on my porch
And I don't even have to ask
I see tears in your eyes
As you come inside and breakdown
So what's he done
And I hope this don't take long
Cause you know one call from him
And you'll be home before morn
Here's a friendly hug
Followed by tough love
Are you ready?

He's only gonna treat you
The way he knows he can
It's all up to you my sista to show him that he can't
Have you had enough
'Cause it's been long enough
Time for a change
Starting with you
No, don't say a word
Listen to Deborah for once
'Cause I went through the same thing
So I'll tell you what needs to be done
Mavis said it best
Girl respect yourself
It starts with you
You want him to be a better man
And you want him to treat you better than you treat yourself,
Girl you can help by showing him how he can
You can start by building your self esteem
Start believing you can do anything
And you'll find your man will fall in line
And if he don't than leave him behind
