F*ck Donald Trump
F*ck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, f*ck Donald Trump (It's for our people)
Yeah, yeah, f*ck Donald Trump
Yeah, f*ck Donald Trump (Ain't nobody else gon' speak up, we gon' speak up)
Yeah, f*ck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, f*ck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, f*ck Donald Trump

I got a question
How'd he make it this far? How the f*ck did it begin?
A Trump rally sounds like Hitler in Berlin
Or KKK shit, now I'm goin' in
I'm just sayin' what's real, I don't give a f*ck who I offend
'Cause it's gotta be said, it's gotta be said
It's off the top like the toupee on Donald Trump's head
This man's not peaceful, racism's evil
This man hates Muslims, that's a billion fuckin' people
If truth be told, Donald is a terrorist
Reasons why the world's got a problem with Americans
The f*ck is goin' on? People just passed
A mass murder happened, you said thanks for the congrats
You tryna get your votes up, you don't got class
Orlando was a tragedy, you react fast
And then made it 'bout you, to boost your campaign
It's goin' all bad if he wins this damn thing
Man America is fucked if he's next up
Take a day to undo what Obama fixed up
It's Young Gerald so you know who said it
And Ivanka can get it, straight up

F*ck Donald Trump
F*ck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, f*ck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, f*ck Donald Trump

Oh we ridin', check it
Now, we protest when we see the tour bus (Bang, bang)
Too scared to get out, that's why the door is shut (Bang, bang)
Your politics are like a Starburst pack (Why?)
Nobody fucks with the orange one (Biatch!)
Bannin' all Muslims? Aiight, bool (This guy)
What if we ban all the white dudes?
Because a couple have run up in trenchcoats and rifles
And killed in the name of Jesus Christ at the high school
How 'bout we stop sellin' automatic guns?
You got rich 'cause your daddy gave you automatic funds
Add it up, you an automatic punk, what it is?
I'm just tryna make America great again! (Mothafucka)
Party in the streets when Hillary wins
If she don't, my girl's half Canadian
Actually nah, I'm not gonna stay with them
I got an eagle on my arm, I'm a patriot
I'mma stay right here, I ain't livin' in fear
With my people who are Muslims, Mexican and queer
And we ain't gonna let you f*ck up four years
Ain't gonna let you f*ck up for years

F*ck Donald Trump
Yeah, f*ck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, f*ck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, f*ck Donald Trump
Yeah, f*ck Donald Trump (Send it over)
Yeah, f*ck Donald Trump (Ain't nobody feelin' your ass)
Yeah, nigga, f*ck Donald Trump (Ain't nobody feelin' you)
Yeah, yeah, f*ck Donald Trump (Here we go again)

Thought I was makin' songs just to ride to?
But come to find out your own kind don't even like you
Macklemore don't like you, G-Eazy don't like you
The rest weenies, they scared to say it, but they don't like you
Obama don't like you, Michelle don't like you
Been tryna make it to one of your rallies but I ain't have time to, punk
Piss on your golf course just to find you
Like where you hidin' at? Who you lyin' to?
F*ck your get rich scheme, I've been ballin' out
You're too old, you keep lyin', that's why your hair fallin' out
Donald Trump, call him out, KKK supporter
His favorite phrase, "Deport 'em," how the f*ck y'all endorse him?
Since America is fucked up anyway
Give Obama a third term, that's what plenty say
Just left Texas, hit the stage for a couple thousand
And had your same color people hollerin'
