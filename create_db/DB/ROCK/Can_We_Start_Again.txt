So many times
I said that I love them
Looking over my shoulder at the door
So many times
I can't live without her
The wheel kept turning round 

My feeling's changed
I went my own way
What can I say 
To make you stay? 
'cause in my dreams
They smother all over me
And I'm trying to explain 

So many arms 
Reach from my memories

Pull all at once
I'm lost amongst
The folds in their skin 
I did you wrong
But I'm sorry now 
And I'll show you how 
If you were here now 
You couldn't change
You wouldn't understand
But I'm ready now I'm ready now
I'll make you proud I was your man

And sing a song
But it's so ugly now
And I'll show you how 
'cause I'm ready now

I'm ready now 
I'm ready now 
I'm ready now 
Hey I'm ready now 
Can we start again?
So many times I said that I loved them

I'm ready now 
But I'm ready now
Can we start again?
So many times
I can't live without her
The years was more than I could bear

It's turning round 
But in my dreams 
Can we start again?
They smother all over me I'm ready now
And I'm trying to explain 
Can we start again? 
So many arms reach from my memory
The wheels kept turning round
