Moving in waves so that
All that you feel
Avoiding the shadows
What they can see
Then the wave starts to break
And the shadows are real
So you reach out to some one
Who holds an idea

They don't say
What you really need to hear
They don't know
What it is they try to say
They don't play
Oh, that same old easy song
You don't know
Who is right or who is wrong

Tell me now
Hear us and the answer we find
Tell me now
The answer is no answer at all
Tell me now
Blaming him to see you tonight
Tell me now
Yes I am, I see you again

And your words that invade
Only shattered of dream
That you build with your life
No one takes any pain
People burned you with reasons
You're caught in the plane

They don't say
What you know you need to hear
They don't know
Then you tell them how you feel
They don't play
Oh, the song that you can't sing

Tell me now
Always have the answer we found
Tell me now
The answer is no answer at all
Tell me now
Blaming him to see you tonight
Tell me now
Here I am to see you again
