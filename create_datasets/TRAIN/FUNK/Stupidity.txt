Hey! (Hey!) 
Everybody! (Everybody!) 

All around the world... 
Every boy and girl 
Take a lesson from me 
And do the Stupidity 

Mama says I look so silly 
My Papa says I look like a fool 
But I don't mind criticism 
Cause I get it every day at school 

Now come along with me 
See how much fun it can be 
And watch it on TV 
Oh baby that's the Stupidity 

Mama says I look so silly 
My Papa says I look like a fool 
But I don't mind criticism 
Cause I get it every day at school 

Now come along with me 
See how much fun it can be 
Watch it on TV 
Oh baby that's the Stupidity 

You make me feel so good 
Just like I knew you would 
Woah yeah 
Now I feel alright 
Hey hey I feel alright!
