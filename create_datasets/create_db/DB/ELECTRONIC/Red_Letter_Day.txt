Sadder than mad in your company
All that we had is never enough
Laugh at the blues
But the blues get a hold on me
And that's sad
Sadder than mad

Wanted to be a part of the family
Wanted to know when I was at home
Laugh at the fool
But the fool takes effect on me
And that's sad
Sadder than mad
And that's sad
Sadder than mad

Trouble in mind
When I think of you
All I find is never enough
I want to talk and talk
But we don't know how
And that's sad
Sadder than mad

I see a treasure isle in front of me
I see a sly smile of contempt
I want to talk and talk
But we make no sense
And that's sad
Sadder than mad
And that's sad
Sadder than mad

Red letter day
And you and I, we're the same
Enlighten my soul
Could you enlighten my soul
And I'm not perfect I know

I'm going to take some time
Make somebody happy
Somebody special

What of the world you think so little of
What of the way you need to be right
All of your days and nights
So all alone
And that's sad
Sadder than mad

Is there a compromise we haven't made
Show me a side I've never seen
All of your days and nights
So lonesome
And that's sad
Sadder than mad
And that's sad
Sadder than mad

Red letter day
And you and I, we're the same
Enlighten my soul
Could you enlighten my soul
And I'm not perfect I know

I'm going to take some time
Make somebody happy
Somebody special

I let the world play on my sympathy
Come on and take whatever you need
Laugh at the blues
But the blues keep affecting me
And that's sad
Sadder than mad
