Stir it up and serve it
Shake it all around
'Cause everybody's groovin'
To what you're putting down

So stir it up and serve it
You're looking so exciting
And when you move it closer
You make it so inviting

Now, when I watch you do
The things you do, now, alright
Girl, it makes me hungry for you

Stir it up and serve it
We'll have a celebration
And everybody's welcome
Don't need an invitation

So stir it up and serve it
'Cause girl, you're really cookin'
And I can't wait to hold you
When there's nobody lookin'

Yeah, when I watch you do
The things you do, now, alright
Girl, it makes me hungry for you

So stir it up and serve it
Shake it all around
Everybody's groovin'
To what you're putting down

So stir up and serve it
You're looking so exiting
Stir it up and serve it
You make it so inviting
