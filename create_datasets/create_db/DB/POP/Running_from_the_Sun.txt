The burning flame is flickering now
I say walk with fire
It's the same dream every night
Don't be scared it'll be alright

And if you hold your thoughts too tight
They'll say you can't keep running from the sun

Then morning comes and they're waking up
Drinking blood from a paper cup
It's the same old dream we all had last night
And they'll be there burning next to you

If you say your prayers tonight
Be careful what you ask
And if you lock your windows tight
Daylight still peaks through cracks

Running from the sun
