It took me five bars, saw thirty license plates
I saw her Mustang and my eyes filled up with rage
I brought my pistol, but I ain't some kinda fool
So I walked right in, barehanded; she was on his arm while he was playing pool
Just like I used to do

She kissed him while I got a beer
She didn't think I'd show up here
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend

I watched her for awhile, but I didn't like her walk
Came across kinda cheap to me, but, hey, how's that my fault?
She looked at my man like he didn't have on a stitch
Somebody tell that girl to step up to the plate
I wanna pitch, little bitch

Those pretty girls can play their game
But they damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend

I started throwing things, and I scared folks half to death
I got up in his face, smelled whiskey on his breath
Didn't give a second thought to being thrown in jail
'Cause, baby, to a hammer everything looks like a nail
I'm mad as hell

Well, those pretty girls - they're all the same
But they're damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
