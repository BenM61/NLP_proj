Dance a little bit closer
Move it like this
A little bit closer
You and me can dance so free

Uh! come a little bit closer
Is like you feel like this
A little bit closer
You and me can dance so free

(I hold you in my arms of love)
Ac?rcate y oye como va mi coraz?n
(Feel to me, only love a star)
Y haremos el amor hasta que te vuelva
Loco, loco, loco.

Dance a little bit closer
Move it like this a little bit closer
You and me what ecstasy

Uh! Come a little bit closer
Is like you feel, like this
A little bit closer
You and me can dance so free

(I hold you in my arms again)
Ac?rcate y oye como va mi coraz?n
Y haremos el amor hasta que te vuelva
Loco, loco, loco

Dance a little bit closer
Move it like this a little bit closer
You and me, it's heavenly
?s un para?so
Uh! Come a little bit closer
Is like you feel, like this
A little bit closer
You and me can dance so free

Uh, I love it, I love it
Dance, dance, dance 2x
Ay me gusta, me gusta, me gusta
Uh, so close, so close, ay que lindo
