When the snows come
And the wind blows cold
Will you hold me
Like you'll never let go?
Will you kiss me so sweetly
And whisper you love me, so?

I have wandered through the mountains
I have searched the streets below
But all I ever really wanted
Was someone to hold me
And to keep me from the cold

And when the night falls
And you're fast asleep
I'll watch over you
And I'll pray your heart to keep
So you can sleep easy
You know you can count on me

I have wandered through the mountains
I have searched the streets below
But all I ever really wanted
Is someone to need me
And to keep me from the cold
Baby, keep me from the cold

Oh darlin' when you're sleeping
Am I with you in your dreams?
Do I hold you close
And dance you through the night?
And when the nightmares come
Will you let me be the one
Who kisses you
And tells you, "It's alright"

And in the morning
When the light creeps in
I will hold you
As you're slowly waking
I'll kiss you so softly
And promise I'll never go

'Cause I have wandered through the mountains
I have searches the streets below
But all I ever really wanted
Is someone to need me
And to keep me from the cold

I have wandered through the mountains
I have searched the streets below
All I ever really wanted
Is for you to love me
I want you to love me
And keep me from the cold

Baby, keep me from the cold
All I ever wanted
So keep me from the cold
Keep me from the cold
Please keep me from the cold
