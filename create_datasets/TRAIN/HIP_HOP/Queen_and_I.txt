I love that how she breathes booze in the mornin'
Man, it's so sexy how she can't remember last night
I made the fatal mistake of lettin' her drink again
Well, who the hell am I to tell her how to live her life?
And if you could put dumb in a shot glass
I'm just another lush who's had one too many in me
Pussy's not enough
Forcin' me to stay and settle for anything
Anything's better than lettin' her
Think she could do better than me
She'll come around eventually

'Cause baby girl's a queen
But the queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm goin' through withdrawal but I got nothin' to lose

Oh no (Hey!)
She's at the bottom of that bottle (Hey! Hey!)
She's only one more swallow (Hey!)
From being oh-so hollow (Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Bravo (Hey!), she's at the bottom of that bottle (Hey! Hey!)
She's only one more swallow (Hey!)
From being oh-so hollow (Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

I find it funny she can never find her car keys
Immediately after telling me she can't take it
She makes the cutest faces when she screams obscenities
And slurs her words because she's never not inebriated
And the front page headline read
Let the girl go; you know you can do better
It's bad when the fact that you can't have her
Is the reason you sweat her
Don't let her take advantage of you
Like the other dudes let her
You better cut your losses now, buddy

'Cause baby girl's a queen
But the queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm goin' through withdrawal but I got nothin' to lose

Oh no (Hey!)
She's at the bottom of that bottle (Hey! Hey!)
She's only one more swallow (Hey!)
From being oh-so hollow (Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Bravo (Hey!), she's at the bottom of that bottle (Hey! Hey!)
She's only one more swallow (Hey!)
From being oh-so hollow (Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

Drown yourself
It's not worth keeping me
Just put it down right now
And bow out gracefully
Drown yourself
It's not worth keeping me
Just put it down right now
And bow out gracefully

Oh no (Hey!)
She's at the bottom of that bottle (Hey! Hey!)
She's only one more swallow (Hey!)
From being oh-so hollow (Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Bravo (Hey!), she's at the bottom of that bottle (Hey! Hey!)
She's only one more swallow (Hey!)
From being oh-so hollow (Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
