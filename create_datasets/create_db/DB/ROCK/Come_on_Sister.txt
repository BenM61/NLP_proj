Six in the morning
The men started working
I can't sleep
No, I can't sleep
I keep feeling the lights
So I think I should get up and call you
Gonna to find you

And it's fun
Thinking of you like a movie star
And it's dumb
Thinking of you like the way that you were

Everyone loves you
The boy in the corner
The postman
The policeman
It does me no good
To keep looking ahead at your future
Adoration

And it's fun
Thinking of you like a movie star
And it's dumb
Thinking of you like the way that you were

Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Every moment that will get you by
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith

I've seen all kinds of strangers
The rich and the famous
They don't count
No, they don't count
Now I'm back on my beat
On the same greasy street
There's an angel on my shoulder
Saying, "Ho, have you ever said an honest word?"
Saying, "Yo, have you ever said a pretty word?"

Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Every moment that will get you by
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
Don't touch me
If you touch me you could never go back

Faith

Come on, sister have a drink
Have a seat at the bar
Tell me all about your men
And your hopes
And the hours of your life

You could love
After all that's what you're looking for
You can love
It's a currency unspoken of

But it's hard to form a good opinion
Yet you're going to look at me that way
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
Don't touch me
If you touch me you can never go back

Faith

Come on, sister have a drink
Have a seat at the bar
Tell me all about your men
And your hopes
And the hours of your life
