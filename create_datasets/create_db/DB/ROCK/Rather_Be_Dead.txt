Rather be dead than alive by your oppression
Rather be dead than alive by your design

Poisoned my fingers
Burned out my eyes
Cut down my throat
To be alive

Rather be dead than alive by your social values
Rather be dead than alive by your tradition

Poisoned my fingers
Burned out my eyes
Cut down my throat
To be alive

Rather be alive
Rather be alive
Rather be alive
Rather be alive

Rather be alive
Rather be alive
Rather be
Rather be alive
Rather be alive
Rather be
Rather be alive
Rather be alive

Poisoned my fingers
Burned out my eyes
Cut down my throat
