You stole a kiss
And stole my heart
Made me a fool right from the start
Wouldn't have been so bad except
This little plan it fell apart

If I were you
I'd dare not speak
I'd run like hell
In hopes of seeing tomorrow

It's such a travesty
The way you say our love should be
Yeah, such a tragedy
Think you can just break my heart and leave me
Well, you better run now
Man on the run
Playing for fun
Wind me up
Leave me undone

These lips are sealed I'll never speak
Your name in loving memory
So don't you try to make amends
That's what you gain for playing me

If I were you
I'd dare not speak
I'd run like hell
In hopes of seeing tomorrow

Break my heart and leave me now
Man on the run

It's such a travesty
The way you say our love should be
Yeah, such a tragedy
Think you can just break my heart and leave me
Well, you better run now
Man on the run
Playing for fun
Wind me up
Leave me undone
