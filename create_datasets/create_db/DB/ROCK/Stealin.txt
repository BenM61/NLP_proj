Stealin'
Take me across the water 'cause I need some place to hide.
I done the rancher's daughter and I sure did hurt his pride.
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah.

Well, there's a hundred miles of desert lies between his hide and mine.
I don't need no food, no water, lord, 'cause I'm running out of time.
Fightin', killin', wine and women gonna put me to my grave.
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin'. nothing left to save
But my life.
 
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah.
Stood on a ridge and stunned religion thinking the world was mine.
I made my break and a big mistake, stealing when I should have been buying.
 
All that fightin', killin', wine and women gonna put me to an early grave.
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin', nothing left to save
But my life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life.
So I stood on a ridge and stunned religion thinking the world was mine.

I made my break and a big mistake, stealing when I should have been buying.
I was stealing when I should have been buying,
I was stealing when I should have been buying.

Stealing when I should have been buying
Stealing when I should have been buying
Stealing when I should have been buying
Stealing when I should have been buying
Stealing woo
Stealing hahaha, yeh

I was stealing when I should have been buying
Stealing oh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Stealing oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Stealing rock'n'roll, alright
Stealing rock'n'roll, alright
Stealing babe, babe

Stealing should, should, should have been buying
Stealing should, should, should have been buying
Stealing should have, should have, should have been buying
Stealing buying, yeah .
