From a walk to a run
By the time they're done there is only rust
And the official language of fucked up and static
And before he speaks
His machines all agree lets wind them up and march them out
History repeated and read out loud

This could be our best weapon now
Said, hey don't look now

Stripes and suits pushing the numbers through
They treat them like they don't exist
And they count them up like they're matchsticks
And they don't recognize until spoken in a headline
They're just more words
They're just more words that I can't wait to unlearn
I can't wait

This could be our best weapon now
Better keep your head down

Said, this could be our best weapon now
Said, hey don't look now
Our best weapon now
