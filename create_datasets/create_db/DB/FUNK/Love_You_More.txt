Since you came inside my life
You've given me the best
In you every day and night
I found my happiness in you
Make me want to ride
To the end of any valley
Then you give me peace of mind
You bring me comfort to my soul
No will never let you know
Make me want to fly
To the top of every rainbow

I love you more every day
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you
I love you more every day
You show your love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you

So promise you will never leave
You never say this is the end
You'll spend your life with me
You'll be my wife
And my best friend
Raise a family
Something we both can treasure
Oh yeah
In the mean time
I'm goin' put in work
You'll goin' be fine
You'll never have to work
So won't you come and fly with me
Forever you and me
The times we supposed to be
I love you only

I love you more every day
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you
I love you more every day
You show your love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you

I don't stop loving you
And I won't stop kissing you
You're the reason why I smile
And I won't stop holding you
And I won't stop loving you
You're the reason why I smile

I love you more every day
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you
I love you more every day
You show your love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you
