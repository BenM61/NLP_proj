Here come old Todd Walker
Full in good gin

Good mornin' friend
I wants me a drink of gin
Good mornin' friend
I wants me a drink of gin
'Cause they told me this mornin'
Revenue men'll be back again

Oh, listen you men
Don't you let him in
Listen, you men
Don't you let him in
Well, they might catch me
Or wait up for him again

Oh, come in friend
And have a drink of gin
Come in friend
And have a drink of gin
I know he deserves sin
But I love my good old gin

Oh, come back friend
When I ain't in my gin
Come back friend
When I ain't in my gin
'Cause I don't care nothin' about
Oh, them old revenue men
