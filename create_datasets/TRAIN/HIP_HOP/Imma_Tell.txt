The killa clowns in ya town raisin all hell

And it ain't no clause that say fraud ain't no tall tale

One, then comes the two to the three and
* That was the anthem no this the anthem
  Hella rockin the planet again you can't stand it again
Huns, they then comin through to see me man
* Then I de-pants 'em and I bust at random
  In a bit I'ma land 'em, dock, women I ram it again
Raise, I love to get high and get paid
* Why do I want to stick 'em wit another hit out of abyss
  Baby you don't want to miss the ISH
Babes they love to come by and get laid
* Why am I at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill 'em in this
  To the hatas I gotta send 'em a gift
Bump this in your ride or in the club
* Givin everybody what they need
  I give it all so they give it all back to me
Hatas don't you hide just show some love
* Do you dig it I'ma rep the be	
  And never ever let the see get the best of me
So many kids put this on their daddies mind
* Never will I put 'em out there like that
  Feelin that I did Tecca Nina take it right back
Tellin him their mommy's boyfriend is Tech N9ne
