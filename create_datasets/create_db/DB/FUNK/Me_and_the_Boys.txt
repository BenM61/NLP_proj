Listen to my story every word is true
I'll tell you how we come together
It was fate, it was great, we didn't hesitate
We were all birds of a feather
Until we started somethin'
The party started jumpin'
Jumpin' to the joyful noise
Where we're coming from, we're born to run
Born to run like Nylons

Me and the boys, yeah me and the boys
Me and the boys, oh, me and the boys
Me and the boys, yeah me and the boys
Me and the boys, rock on boys yeah
Yeah, yeah, we get together, we make a little noise
The boys, the boys, the boys, the boys

Cookin' in the kitchen with my eyes on the stars
I wonder when I'm gonna get to heaven
Got a place to go to that is not too far
When I get off work at 11:00
Goin' up to the rooftop, can't stop, too hot
One of life's natural joys
Well me and the guys like to harmonize
Beneath the skies

Me and the boys, yeah boys
Yeah boys, yeah boys

Now I come from Carolina down Atlanta way
With a suitcase full of rhythm and blues
You know I love you baby but I just can't stay
'Cause I got on my travellin' shoes
Well, I'm gonna do it now, try my best to settle down
But I never could endure
The straight and simple life, it never did seem right
And that's why I'm here tonight and I'm singin' with my

Boys, me and the boys, me and the boys, me and the boys
Me and the boys, me and the boys, me and the boys, me and the boys

Dance, well I can really dance
You ought to see me move across the floor, yeah
Romance, well I took a chance
I didn't know what I had bargained for
Heartbreaks heartaches I just couldn't take
Stop treating me like a toy
When out of the blue they came to my rescue
Now all I want to do is just a doo-doo-wop

Me and the boys, me and the boys
Me and the boys, me and the boys, me and the boys
