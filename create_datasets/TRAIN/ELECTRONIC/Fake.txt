Your name was Patty
but now it's Kay
Girl
you seem to change it every day.
Your hair was long
but now it's short
You say: I got it cut
but I don't see no hair upon the floor.
Whenever I go out with you I find out something new.
You're a fake
baby
you can't conceal it
Know how I know
'cause I can feel it.
You're a fake
baby
no rhyme or reason
'Cause in your mind it's lyin' season.
You had brown eyes
but now they're blue
Those false eyelashes that you're wearin'
too.
In bed this morning you called me CIyde
Alex is the name that I go by!
If women could be counterfit
then you'd be it.
You're a fake
baby
you can't conceal it
. . .
You're a fake
baby
I've blown your cover
the iig is up
'cause I discovered -
You're a fake
baby
no need to hide it
Can't change my mind
'cause I've decided -
You're a fake
baby
and I'm disgusted
The game is through and
girl
you're busted
fake!
Whenever I go out with you I find out something new.
You're a fake
you always have a good excuse
But
girl
that ain't no use.
You're a fake
baby
you can't conceal it
. . .
You're a fake
baby
no rhyme or reason
. . .
You're a fake
baby
Fake
fake!
