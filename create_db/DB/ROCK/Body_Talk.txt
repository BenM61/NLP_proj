I know what you mean
When you look like that
I read you like a book
When you look like that
She don't like to hide
Any feelings deep inside
And that's, that's just what I need
Something just like you to read
Anyway I can see there isn't any mystery
You don't have to read minds to know that you're my kind
They know that she talks body talk
Pictures I can see
She talk body talk (Body talk, body talk)
She talk body talk
Music I can see
She talk body talk (Body Talk)
Talk to me
They call you extreme
You're my flesh, flesh and blood dream
Can I still be asleep if my point of view's skin deep
Anyway I can see there isn't any mystery
You don't have to read minds to know you're my kind
(chorus)
You're gonna feel my reaction tonight
Tonight we're gonna make this attraction tonight - tonight
Anyway I can see there isn't any mystery
You don't have to read minds to know you're my kind
Talk (talk) Talk (talk talk)
Talk to me (body talk) Talk (body talk body talk)
Talk (talk) Talk (talk talk)
Talk to me (body talk) Talk (body talk)
She talk She talks body talk
Pictures I can see
She talks body talk (body talk)
Talk to me (body talk body talk)
She talk body talk
Music I can see she talk (body talk)
Talk to me
