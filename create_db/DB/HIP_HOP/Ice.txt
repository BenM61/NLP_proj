You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot (hot)
Baby your love is so hot hot (hot)

Pull up, she been purring like a kitten
Cravin' your love
I've been counting on the days you been gone
A little too long, patient
Knowing exactly what it is
It lasts, time, and now
When you, come and lay between it this time
Take the ice cube (boy you know what)
Sit it right below my navel
And watch what I do
And that's my favorite angle
My legs are numb now
Your loving be giving me chills

You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot (hot)
Baby your love is so hot hot (hot)

Uh, ice ice baby
Shake that ass just like dice baby
You hot, and I'm Tunechi
I beat the cat, animal cruelty
I'm colder than your man
He should be your ex
Now throw that ass back like we playing pitch and catch, fuckin' right
And all your hear is what's my name, it's your pussy
Sweet tooth roll tussy
If you are what you eat I'm so pussy
I'm skating on thin ice
I put in her windpipe, we do it til we both exhausted
Twin pipes, pillow under her stomach
The other pillow she bite
Would you like anything
Cause I'll do anything you like
Um, I make her freeze up
Pick her knees up, she want a maid
Watch me clean up, I know where to put it
I put it in her life
I leave that pussy smoking
Smoking like ice

You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot (hot)
Baby your love is so hot hot (hot)

You put the pillow (right there)
Underneath my back
Got me up against the window (right now)
We got no shame we going in
He hates it when I use my hands
He got me saying, 'damn my man knows what he's doing'

The mirrors, the mirrors
Up on the ceiling, got things so visual, so visual
Babe I ain't never felt so right yeah
He comes again my body going numb
Hot as ice, can't get enough

You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot (hot)
Baby your love is so hot hot (hot)
You're like ice
