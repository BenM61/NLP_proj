Ow!
Ho!

A lot of people say that you can make it in this world today.
But, I know exactly how, I'd like to show ya if you let me now.

Just be yourself, say what's on your mind, just be yourself, put it on the line just be yourself. Just be yourself put it on the line!

If you think you have something to say, don't you hold back just...say it. Why do you think you have to take all that the people say?

Sometimes it might take long to clear your mind and make yourself feel strong. 

I know its worth the wait just tighten up and keep your head on straight. Just be yourself say what's on your mind just be yourself.

Put it on the line just be yourself, say what's on your mind, just be yourself, put it on the line!

If you think you have something to say, don't you hold back just, say it. Why do you think you have to take all that the people say?

You've got to get your nerve up
Your nerve up
Your nerve up

You've got to get your nerve up
Your nerve up
Your nerve up
