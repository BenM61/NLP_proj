I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard 
For love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still I fall in love so easily 
I fall in love too fast
 
My heart should be well schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
