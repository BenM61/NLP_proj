A perfect face comes calling
A perfect hand reaches out
Her perfect face in the morning
December girl feels the same
She needs to find a place
Cause she never looked so good when she was down

She's blonde on white
White on blonde
Her perfections are now gone
Reflections everywhere
If you gaze for too long
It will fade and then it's gone
Reflections everywhere

Imagine naked legs falling
Walking barefoot in the rain
Imagine freezing cold weather
December girl feels the same
She needs to find a place
Cause she never looked so good when she was down

She's blonde on white
White on blonde
Her perfections are now gone
Reflections everywhere
If you gaze for too long
It will fade and then it's gone
Reflections everywhere
