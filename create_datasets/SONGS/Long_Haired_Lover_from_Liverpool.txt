I'll be your long haired lover from Liverpool, 
And I'll do anything you say. 
I'll be your clown or your puppet or your April Fool, 
If you'll be my sunshine daisy from L.A.

I'll be your leprechaun and sit upon an old toad stool, 
I'll serenade you till I'm old and gray. 
I'll be your long haired lover from Liverpool, 
You'll be my sunshine daisy from L.A.

You'll be my lovely daisy on the mountainside, 
There are lots of other flowers, too. 
But all the other flowers hung their heads and cried
Because the loveliest of all of them was you.

But you were evidently the exception to the rule, 
I picked you quickly then I ran away. 
'Cause I was your long haired lover from Liverpool, 
You were my sunshine daisy from L.A.

I'll be your long haired lover from Liverpool, 
And I'll do anything you ask. 
I'll be your clown or your puppet or your April Fool, 
Cut my hair, I'll even wear a mask.

I'll be your Valentine, and you'll be mine, and things'll be cool. 
We'll move along together every day.
I'll be your long haired lover from Liverpool, 
You'll be my sunshine daisy from L.A., 
You'll be my sunshine daisy from L.A.

I'll be your long haired lover from Liverpool, 
And I'll do anything you ask. 
I'll be your clown or your puppet or your April Fool, 
Cut my hair I'll even wear a mask.

I'll be your Valentine, and you'll be mine, and things'll be cool. 
We'll move along together every day. 
I'll be your long haired lover from Liverpool, 
You'll be my sunshine daisy from L.A.
