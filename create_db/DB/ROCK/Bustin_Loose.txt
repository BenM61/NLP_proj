Well, the kid checked his stance and tightened his pants
And took his first step in the night
Jacko said that he'd fix him up with a girl who'd be alright
Well, he picked him up in his Sandman, they raced every red light in town
Jacko put on a real cool face but he's sweatin', there's no cops around

So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose

He's got a matchbox of pot hidden in a secret spot
Which they'll smoke in the old schoolyard
Well, he's never too sure if he gets stoned or not
But tonight he's gonna try awful hard

And he's fifteen or sixteen, he's tryin' to make the mean team
And Jacko's his man all the way
He'll go for broke if he can, he knows that Jacko's his man
And they both pray that they'll get away

So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose
So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose

Well, every guy's a clumsy poet and every girl's a beauty queen
Well, they're fogging up the windows of their friends parked cars
On the way to their land of dreams, you know what I mean

Well, he remembers the nights when the stars they burned bright
And she let him go all the way
Said it was different that time 'cause she said take your time
Slow down let me show you the way

Well, the sand was warm underneath where they lay
A cool breeze made the waves dance and play
A band played in the hall, they were loud it was small
But who listened anyway

And every guy's a clumsy poet and every girl's a beauty queen
But they're so caught up in appearances
That they don't really know what they mean

So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose
So, oh-oh-oh, oh he's bustin' loose, woh-oh-oh, he's bustin' loose

I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
