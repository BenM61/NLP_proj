Every morning I wake up by your side
Ohh my feeling is so strong I cannot hide
I want to hold you every second that I live
And when you ain't next to me I get possessive
You make me happy and you buy me things
Cars and chicks and diamond rings
All the stuff that is blinkin'

Money, ohh money
Be my baby
Drive me crazy
Money, ohh money
Wanna hold you
Just like I told you

Some people say that money isn't everything
I tell them no, look, you also need that diamond ring
And a ton of gold and a lot of shares
Your honey she wants a private jet
Man who cares
You satisfy me and you turn me on
And that is why I sing this song
My dream is to own a money money factory
So pay me

Money, ohh money
Be my baby
Drive me crazy
Money, ohh money
Wanna hold you
Just like I told you

Money, money, money
Oh gimme gimme more
Gimme more money
Where's my money?
Haa haa alright
You know I spend you
Money, money, money
Gimme more money
And now I spend you for free
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme more baby

Money, ohh money
Be my baby
Drive me crazy
Money, ohh money
Wanna hold you
Just like I told you

Money, ohh money
Be my baby
Drive me crazy
Money, oh money
Wanna hold you
Just like I told you

Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money
I told you, I told you, I told you
I'm gonna, gonna gonna hold you
For the rest of my life
Hey you shouldn't go away
'Cause you are so beautiful
I told you I was gonna hold you
And now I do love you
