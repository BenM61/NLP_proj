South of the border down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when stars above came out to play
Now as I wander my thoughts ever stray south of the border down Mexico way
She was a picture in old Spanish lace
And for a tender while I kissed the smile opon her face
For it was Fiesta we were so gay south of the border down Mexico way
And she smiled and she whispered Manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied and I whispered Manana for our tomorrow never came
South of the border I rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
And the mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border down Mexico way

Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
