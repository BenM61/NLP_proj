So why doesn't it all just come for us?*
Only the strong will survive
A future, a beauty, a happening.

Can't this be for all of us
Just a happy ending
Can't this be for all of us
Just a happy ending

Breathless bodies raise their fists into the air
These circles of hatred is all we will ever see
A curse given to the willing
Forever remember this
For our time is upon us

Apologies are for the weak
Wish and dream not only for what you are missing
Wish and dream for everything
Be by my side this was supposed to last forever, last forever
Yous wish and dream not only for what you are missing,
You are missing

The sky will be the same for both of us
It will rise and then it will fall
The sky will be the same for both of us
A curse given to the willing
Forever remember this
For our time is upon us
Apologies are for the weak
