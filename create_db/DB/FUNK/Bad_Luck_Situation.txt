Yeah, woo
The full moon, it is rising and the rain is falling down
Looking for my woman but she ain't nowhere around
Woo ho

She in a bad luck situation, gonna shoot my baby down
I don't share or have no mercy, I got murder on my mind
She in a bad luck situation 'cause she treat me so unkind
Woo ho

Just like today you livin' but tomorrow you could be dying,
Yeah
Ow, yeah, (boogie, with it)?
Woo, alright, yeah
Got my mojo in my pocket
Got my pistol in my hand

I've been thinkin'. 
I've been wonderin', but I just don't understand
Gonna sure enough fix my woman where she don't meet no other man
Uh, woo, alright, ow
