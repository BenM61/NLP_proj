I was by myself
Tryin' to get my thoughts together
Tryin' to figure out me something
That would make my life a little better

So I came up with one thing
And I don't think I'm wrong
Ain't nothing but a fool
Want to live his life alone

So, I got to get myself somebody
Somebody to call my own
'Cause it ain't nothing but a fool
Want to live his life all alone

From log rollers to ditch diggers
From beggars to presidents
Whoah, everybody's got somebody
If they got a little sense

So, I got to get myself somebody
Somebody to call my own
Ain't nothing but a fool
Want to live his life all alone

Gettin' used to my baby's ways
Is the price I'm gonna pay
Gonna love her everyday
When she talk too much
And not know what she say

Gonna hold on to you baby
Like a dog holds on to a bone
'Cause nothing in this world
Want to live his life alone

So, I got to get myself somebody
Somebody to call my own
'Cause it's nothing but a fool
Want to live his life all alone, all alone

Well I get so lonely sometimes so lonely
Oh I get so lonely sometimes I'm all alone
I'm all alone
