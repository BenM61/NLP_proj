I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.
I love to hear the thunder,
Watch the lightnin' when it lights up the skies.
You know it makes me feel good.

I love a rainy night,
It's such a beautiful sight.
I love to feel the rain on my face,
Taste the rain on my lips,
In the moonlight shadow.

Showers wash all of my cares away.
I wake up to a sunny day...

'Cause I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.

I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.
I love to hear the thunder,
Watch the lightnin' when it lights up the skies.
You know it makes me feel good.

I love a rainy night,
It's such a beautiful sight.
I love to feel the rain on my face,
Taste the rain on my lips,
In the moonlight shinin'.

It puts a song in this heart of mine.
It puts a smile on my face every time...

'Cause I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.

Showers wash all of my cares away.
I wake up to a sunny day...

'Cause I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.
I love a rainy night.

I love a rainy night
(You see it in my eyes)
I love a rainy night
(Yeah, it makes me high)
I love a rainy night
(You know I do)
I love a rainy night.

I love a rainy night
(You see it in my eyes)
I love a rainy night
(Yeah, it makes me high)
I love a rainy night
(And I love you too)
I love a rainy night.
