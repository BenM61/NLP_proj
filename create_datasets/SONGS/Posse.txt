Tyree cooper the producer
But now it's scooter
Who are supa dupa
I'm the hard rhymer
The track attacker
The mic enforcer
The chick's checker

I am the law

I'm the quarterback of the scene
We bring the noise and make you scream
What? !
Candyman, that's who I am
Dave - the track attacker
The mic enforcer
The chick' checker

I'm bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher
In other words sucker there is no other
I'm bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher
In other words sucker I've got no brother

Bring the break

We need you on the floor

Back on the track, ride on
Hard as hell, though you did not expect
What? !
Candyman, the dope jam
Ice - the mad rhymer
The pitch shifter
The quick trigger

I'm bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher
In other words sucker there is no other
I'm bigger and bolder and rougher and tougher
In other words sucker I've got no brother

And herer comes the break


We need you on the floor

Yeah we want some pussy
Check your watch, we'll never stop
Posse, don't get asleep
Rock to the beat, rock to the beat,
Rock to the beat, now!

Hands up in the air!
Come on!

We need you on the floor

We need you on the floor
