I jump up at dawn, shake out the sun,
Laugh like a loon, have plenty fun,
It's crazy, but I'm in love!

I act like a fool, what do I care?
I'll be a fool as long as you're there,
It's crazy, but I'm in love!

I spread my wings and then I'll fly
All around the city.
The world's my sweet potato pie,
And I'm sitting pretty!

I sweep out the stars, chase that old moon,
Fall into bed a-hummin' a tune,
It's crazy, but I'm in love, love, love, love'
It's crazy, but I'm in love!

I spread my wings and then I'll fly
All around the city.
The world's my sweet potato pie,
And I'm sitting pretty!

It's crazy, but I'm in love!

I sweep out the stars, chase that old moon,
Fall into bed a-hummin' a tune,
It's crazy, but I'm in love, love, love, love'
Mm, mm, it's crazy, but I'm in love!
