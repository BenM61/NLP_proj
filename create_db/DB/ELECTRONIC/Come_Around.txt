You're the only one, (you're the only one)
said you're the only one
Ooh baby (ooh baby)
You're the only one, (you're the only one)

The more I give the more you're wanting
Baby I try real hard to make you happy
Maybe I don't say I love you like I use to
please never doubt that I love you
and I mean what I say...

[Chorus]
Lady Have no fear, I'm right here
Won't you come around?
just come around.
Lady Have no fear, I'm right here
Won't you come around?
Our love will come around.

Babe

Don't trip when I come in home late.
You must not know just how much you mean?
Go if you're going to leave, just be sure;
Cause all you want and need won't be ignored.
I don't care what your friends have to say,
I don't really care what it is they think.
I'm working hard tryin' to make these ends meet.
I'm not going nowhere,
baby please believe me...

[Chorus: x2]

I won't let that, that cause me to lose you, (?)
cause I'ma love you everyday!
(N-n-no no no)
Just want that feeling, that we use to
Cause I'ma love you everyday of my life.

[Chorus]

The more I give the more you're wanting
baby I try real hard to make you happy
Maybe I don't say I love you like I use to
please never doubt that I love you
and I mean what I say...

[Chorus]

Come around,
Come around,
Come around.
Oh I need you.
Girl I love you.
I love you.
