She throws her clothes 
On the bedroom floor
Crawls cross the bed 
She begs me for more
She's always there at the scene 
Of a crime
(She's got twisted mind)
We're buried 6 foot deep
In the sheets
She ties me down
She's a torturous tease
We toss and turn 
In the heat of the night
(She's got twisted mind)
Scream
The creature from my dreams 
Is lying next to me 
I love it,
But I'm terrified cause she 
Has got control of me
The creature from my dreams
She's a beautiful nightmare 
Banging on the bedroom wall
She's a nightmare 
Kissing, scratching,
Screaming for more
She's a nightmare
Ooohhh
Can't sleep, 
She keeps,
Me up all night
She's always there
When I think I'm alone 
She got me scared
To just pick up the phone
She got that murderous 
Look in her eye
(She's got a twisted mind)
I'm like the puppet 
She's pulling the strings
I've tried to leave 
But she is sucking me in
She feeds me nothing 
But lie, after lie
(She got a twisted mind)
Scream 
The creature from my dreams
Is lying next to me
I love it, but I'm terrified 
Cause she,
Has got control of me
The creature from my dreams
She's a beautiful nightmare 
Banging on the bedroom wall
She's a nightmare 
Kissing, scratching, 
Screaming for more
She's a nightmare
Oohhhh
Can't sleep, 
She keeps, me up all night
She's my poison, so hypnotic
She's discovered it in my closet
Tryina get away cause she's so erotic
She caught me
When you think she's getting closer
Facing me since we been over
Tryina get away but she knows I want 'er
She caught me
She caught me
She caught me
Caught me, caught me
She's a beautiful nightmare
Banging on the bedroom wall
She's a nightmare
Kissing, scratching, screaming for more
She's a nightmare
Ooohhh
She's a beautiful nightmare
Banging on the bedroom wall
She's a nightmare
Kissing, scratching, screaming for more
She's a nightmare
Ooohh
Can't sleep, she keeps me up all night
