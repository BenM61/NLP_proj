All the years have come, and the years have gone,
But the oft told tale is not true,
For of all the things the Danube is,
The Danube is not blue.

The Danube is green,
What's more it ain't clean.
It's green as a bean.
It ain't not serene.

And though the blueberry looks a little purple,
And though your maple syrup looks a little murple,
Don't believe what you have heard or you have saw.
Oh the Danube isn't blue, it's green.

Oh, the Danube is green as the grass in the spring
It's as green as the dollar you spend on a fling.
It's as green as the paint that you put on the screen.
Oh the blue of the Danube is greener than green.

The Danube isn't blue (Am I blue? No!)
The Danube has another hue (Who? Me? You!)
It's time we all came clean, (B.O.)
'Cause the Danube isn't blue, it's green.
