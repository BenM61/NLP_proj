Hey girl
I got somethin' real important to give you
So just sit down and listen

Girl you know we've been together such a long long time
(Such a long time)
And now I'm ready to lay it on the line
Wow, you know it's Christmas and my heart is open wide
(Open wide)
Gonna give you something so you know what's on my mind
(What's on my mind)

A gift real special, so take off the top
Take a look inside it's my dick in a box
It's in a box

Not gonna get you a diamond ring
That sort of gift don't mean anything
Not gonna get you a fancy car
Girl, ya gotta know you're my shinin' star

Not gonna get you a house in the hills
A girl like you needs somethin' real
Wanna get you somethin' from the heart
Somethin' special girl

It's my dick in a box
My dick in a box babe
It's my dick in a box
Ooh, my dick in a box girl

See I'm wise enough to know
When a gift needs givin', and I got just the one
Somethin' to show ya that you are second to none

To all the fellas out there with ladies to impress
It's easy to do just follow these steps

1, cut a hole in a box
2, put your junk in that box
3, make her open the box
And that's the way you do it

It's my dick in a box
My dick in a box babe
It's my dick in a box
Ooh, my dick in a box girl

Christmas, dick in a box
Hanukkah, dick in a box
Kwanzaa, a dick in a box
Every single holiday a dick in a box

Over at your parents' house, a dick in a box
Mid-day at the grocery store, a dick in a box
Backstage at the CMA's, a dick in a box

My dick in a box
My dick in a box
My dick in a box
