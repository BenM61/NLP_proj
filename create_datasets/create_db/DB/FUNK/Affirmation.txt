Intuition I could not ignore
Came to help me in my time of danger
Wasn't easy walking out the door
But I knew any other place was safer
And the freedom that I now enjoy
Helps the bruises in my heart to face
'Cause I know I am not afraid

You can never feel the joy and pain
That you've never known
Far too much emotion to explain
In a story that is not your own

How you gonna try to sing the blues
When the only key you know is major?
Walk a mile in someone else's shoes
And the ups and downs have got to change ya

You can't tell me that you understand
'Til my bitter tears roll down your face
'Til you're standing in my place

You can never feel the joy and pain
That you've never known
Far too much emotion to explain
In a story that is not your own

Now I've got it together
I will always remember
Where I've been, where I'm going
Why I'm here, why I'm living
Now I've got it together
There's no more desperation
Only my affirmation
To live for me

You can never feel the joy and pain
That you've never known
Far too much emotion to explain
In a story that is not your own
