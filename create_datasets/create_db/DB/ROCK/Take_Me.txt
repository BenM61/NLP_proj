Take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

So take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

I lit my pain on fire
and I watched it all burn down
Now I'm dancing in the ashes
and there's no one else around
Cause I want to be apart of something
This is just a story of a broken soul

As days go by, my heart grows cold
I can't seem let this all pass me by

So take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

So take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

I'm burning in the heavens
and I'm drowning in the hell
My souls in a coma
and none of my friends can tell
I'm reaching out of getting something
This is just a story of a broken soul

As days go by, my heart grows cold
I can't seem let this all pass me by

So take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

So take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

Don't shut me out

Does anyone around me feel the same
Just put your fist up and vent your pain
Does anyone around me feel the same
Put your fist up and vent your pain
Does anyone around me feel the same
Put your fist up and vent your pain
Does anyone around me feel the same
Put your fist up and vent your pain

As days go by, my heart grows cold
I can't seem let this all pass me by

So take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

So take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

As days go by, my heart grows cold
I can't seem let this all pass me by

Take me
Don't break me
