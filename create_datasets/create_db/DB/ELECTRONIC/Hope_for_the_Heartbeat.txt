Kisses on wings or the lure of destiny, 
Love over sex over lust over ecstasy, 
Tender or brittle, take your chance, 
Come to your senses, enter the trance
Hope for the heartbeat
Hope for the heartbeat

Here is a rumour I have heard, 
You believe in your past like a weeping bird, 
Well, here we stand on the naked edge, 
The view from here really takes my breath away
Hope for the heartbeat
Hope for the heartbeat

Girl with the mouth of microphone, 
You kiss my lips and I kiss your chrome, 
Sleep is the key to another world, 
The things I dream nearly blow my mind away
Hope for the heartbeat
Hope for the heartbeat
