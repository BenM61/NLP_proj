I want to be where the boys are
But I'm not allowed
I wait outside of the boy's bar
I wait for them to all come out
 
I'm not a
Boy
 
It's not my fault
That I'm not a boy
It's not my fault
I don't have those toys
 
I'm not a
Boy
 
And now it's alright
Without those boys
I stay at home at night
And I play with my toys
 
I'm not a
Boy
