I saw them drinking at every vine
They told the loss was like the first
And they came upon no wine
It tastes so good everyday as thirst
I watch them go at every root
And yes, they ate from every pot
But they came upon no fruit
It tastes so good every day as once

And there is too much time, drinking, never mind
And it can't be always like the first
Step in the line, root mixed with the vine
And it will bring you back your thirst
There's too many days in a Heatrow maze
Wondering if I ever been there before
Step in the line, root mixed with the vine
An invitation to the course

Oh, keep me coming back for more
Keep me knocking at her door
Wondering if I truly soar
The very thing I came here for
Give your grape and I will give my bean
Back to the vinta and the manga
Cause we can lay down, lean with your thirst
And with my hunger

And there is too much time, drinking, never mind
And it can't be always like the first
Step in the line, root mixed with the vine
And it will bring you back your thirst
There's too many days in a Heatrow maze
Wondering if I ever been there before
Step in the line, root mixed with the vine
An invitation to the course

Oh, keep me coming back for more
Keep me knocking at her door
Wondering if I truly soar
The very thing I came here for

Back to the vinta and the manga
Cause we can lay down, lean with your thirst
