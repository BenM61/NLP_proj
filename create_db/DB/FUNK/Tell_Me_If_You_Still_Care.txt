Tell me 
If you still care 
Tell me 
If you still care 

Lyrics courtesy the Top40db. 

Let me know 
Have you started to lose 
Your love for me 
And if so 
Will you still continue 
To be on my side 

Tell me 
If you still care about me (Tell me, girl) 
Tell me 
If you still care about me 

I was so 
Insecure with you 
Did you still want me 
So I let go 
Of the feeling that you 
Were still all mine 

Tell me 
If you still care about me (Show me that you care) 
Tell me 
If you still care about me 

Must we both 
Go on being confused 
And placing blame 
My heart knows 
That you're my number one 
Do you feel the same way too 

Tell me 
If you still care about me (If you still care) 
Tell me 
If you still care about me 

Yes, I know 
That I still love you 
You're forever on my mind 
And it's so hard to let go 
What I feel for you 
You've blown my mind 

And captured all my love with your sweetness 
And I gave it to you, baby, from my heart 
So if we really care for each other 
Tell me, baby [Tell me], why are we apart 

Tell me 
If you still care about me (If you still care) [Do you really care?] 
(Listen to my heart beat for you, baby, woo) Tell me [Tell me] 
If you still care about me (Do you feel the same way too) 

Tell me [Ooh, tell me] 
If you still care about me (Baby, I still care) 
Tell me [Tell me] 
If you still care about me (Baby, you're my number one) 

Tell me (And tell me do you still care?) 
If you still care [Yes, I care] about me 
Tell me [Tell me] 
If you still care about me (You're forever on my mind) 

Tell (Listen to my heart beat) me 
If you still care about me about me 
Tell me (Tell me) 
If you still care about me (Do you feel the same way too) 

Tell me 
If you still care (Listen to my heart beat) 
With you near me, when you hold me 
Can you kiss me (Do you feel the same way too, woo) 

If you still care 
If you still care 

Woo 

If you still care
