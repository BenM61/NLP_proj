You can have my body
But you can't keep it
You can't keep it

You should know
I don't fall in love with everyone I sleep with
One I sleep with
'Cause when I'm done
I'm done
I'll run
I'll run
Where my spirit takes me beyond this
Yeah when I'm done
I'm done
I'll run
I'll run
Sometimes you have to take back what you give
I'm into the one
I'm with till I'm over the one
I'm with
So I guess it's over with
I guess it's over with
What ever you thought
I said
What ever you thought
We did
I'll take it back
I'll take it back
Tell Roy and his trusty old trigger
I'm an Indian giver
I'll take my heart back
Thank you very much
I'm an Indian giver
I'll take my heart back
Thank you very much
I'm an Indian giver
You can have my body
But you can't keep it
You can't keep it
You should know
We could fall in love
But this is what the deal is
What the deal is
'Cause when I'm done
I'm done
I'll run
I'll run
Where my spirit takes me beyond this
Yeah, when I'm done
I'm done
I'll run
I'll run
Sometimes you have to take back what you give
