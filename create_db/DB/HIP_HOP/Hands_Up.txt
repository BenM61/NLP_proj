Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up

Hands up, shorty when you party with me
We goin' way past quarter to three
I said hands up, I'm good in the V.I.P.
I got my h***** right here with me

I said hands up, you know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jooks
I said hands up, everything ain't cruise to fame
This s*** ain't sweet as it looks, I said hands up

You know I'm puttin' something on me
Right before I leave outta the car, we came to party
You go tough talkin' at me you
Gon' leave outta the club with a scar, we came to party

We pop bottles like it's all free
Fo' I leave I'ma buy out the bar, we came to party
You can order what you want it's on me
I'm a G take a look at star, we came to party

It feels so good to live sucker free
I'm soakin' it all up while your girl s***in' me
It mean the world to her, it's nothing but a n** to me
Look miss, get a grip and let a motherf***er be

I'm a rap star who wants to be ridin' around in that car
Two in the front and the back got the plasma
This ain't a free ride you gotta have the g** ma
I wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma

And I'm busy so I move a bit faster
You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya
I'm a b******
Damn near showin' his hand over the plastic

'Cause they wanna see your man go in the casket
Rule number one, keep your g** and get your a** hit, that's it
Lights off and your body's stiff
By the same n****s you used to party with

Hands up, shorty when you party with me
We goin' way past quarter to three
I said hands up, I'm good in the V.I.P.
I got my h***** right here with me

I said hands up, you know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jooks
I said hands up, everything ain't cruise to fame
This s*** ain't sweet as it looks, I said hands up

Fo' I leave I'ma buy out the bar, we came to party
You can order what you want it's on me
I'm a G take a look at star, we came to party

I cruise through the strip, 22's on the whip
New r*** gonna hit thousand dollar outfit
Never snooze never slip, follow rules or get whip
N**** move or get hit, I don't care who's on the strip

It ain't only the Ferrari now the jewels got him sick
Now it's 2006 I need a new bottom miss
It's aight they can talk I'm amused by them p*****
I'm the news out the bricks n**** who's hot as this

I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed
I ain't a cuddler I f*** the drool outta chick
My n****z ice grill, but it ain't the same
They don't see the faces, they just see the chains like

Ooh, when ya get 'em, they don't know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me
This regular s***, the everyday mentality
They charged up, don't make me put in the battery

I said hands up, you know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jooks
I said hands up, everything ain't cruise to fame
This s*** ain't sweet as it looks, I said hands up

You know I'm puttin' something on me
Right before I leave outta the car, we came to party
You go tough talkin' at me you
Gon' leave outta the club with a scar, we came to party

Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
