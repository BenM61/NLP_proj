You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
Think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees

I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there, hold you tight to me
When you're on my outside, baby, and you can't get in
I will show you, you're so much better than you know

When you're lost
You're alone and you can't get back again
I'll find you, darling, and I'll bring you home

And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine

You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
Think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees

I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me

Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there, hold you tight to me
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there by your side, baby

Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there, hold you tight to me
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there by your side, baby
