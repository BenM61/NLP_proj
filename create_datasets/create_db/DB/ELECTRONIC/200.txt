Everything right
Everything right
Everything right
Everything right
All these niggas
Everything right, you back in Givenchy
I only drink Actavis, I'm on a diet
I'ma chase it like Hussain
All this money bring a nigga new pain (woah, woah, woah)
Yeah, yeah

I got at least 200 hoes
Fresh to death, and I leave my current in a doze
Up and down you ain't receive nothin' 'bout this dough
And these hundreds ain't goin' nowhere like a moat

I bought my moms a car, it felt amazin'
My niggas bangin' burgundy like the Redskins
I got all type of tattoos on my fuckin' shin
I was in a white and red Maybach like peppermints
I've been blown a mil' on jewelry, but it's past tense
Super charge it, make it sound like it's raggly
I'm ridin' with the cutter, I'm Blood like my brothers, a MAC 10
Diamonds on me talkin', they harassin'
No shoulda, coulda, woulda, I got these racks in
Came a long way from a Chevy
Now we spend millions on cribs
You get somethin' too, don't trip
My eyes 'bout low as a brim
I smoke the tree limb, tree limb
No gang, big deal

I'm tryna pop a wheelie in a Lamborghini standin' on two wheels
I got the racks on me, now I can buy me a cruise ship
I just got an iPhone 8 and already stored it with 200 hoes
You can smell the money on me, it comes from off my clothes
My Jordan fits I wear, yeah never found in stores
You might as well gon', gon', gon' home
Money long, long, long, long
All way up to Mercury
Any time I come out, gotta step out with a three piece
I've been in my bag lately, take three drugs at once lately
Got every shade of Tom Ford, I can spot fugazi
I came out the slums, I got Hermes in a headlock
If she ain't up to par, she 'bout to get dead docked
Between my diamonds and my fame, became so anxious
I sit at the top of the throne, yeah, 'cause I'm righteous
Got a few Vice Lords for some friends, some of 'em disciples
And can't nothin' come between niggas like us

I got at least 200 hoes
Fresh to death, and I leave my current in a doze
Up and down you ain't receive nothin' 'bout this dough
And these hundreds ain't goin' nowhere like a moat
