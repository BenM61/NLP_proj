I love coffee, I love tea, 
I love the Java Jive and it loves me 
Coffee and tea and the java and me, 
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup! 

I love java sweet and hot, 
Whoops, Mister Moto, I'm a coffee pot 
Shoot me the pot, and I'll pour me a shot, 
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup! 

Oh slip me a slug from the wonderful mug 
And I'll cut a rug 'til I'm snug in a jug 
A slice of onion and a raw one, Draw one! 
Waiter, waiter, percolator! 

I love coffee, I love tea, 
I love the Java Jive and it loves me 
Coffee and tea and the java and me, 
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup! 

Boston beans (soy beans) 
I said the little itty-bitty green bean (cabbage n' greens) 
You know that I'm not keen about a bean, 
Unless it is a chile chile bean! (Talk it, boy!) 

I love java sweet and hot, 
Whoops, Mister Moto, I'm a coffee pot (yeah) 
You shoot me the pot, and I'll pour me a shot, 
A cup, a cup, a cup, 'an dat zat bootle! 

Blow me a slug from that wonderful mug 
And I'll cut a rug that's snug in a jug 
Drop a nickel in my pot, Joe, takin' it slow 
Waiter, waiter percolator 

I love coffee, I love tea, 
I love the Java Jive an' it loves me 
Coffee and tea and the java and me 
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup - Boy!
