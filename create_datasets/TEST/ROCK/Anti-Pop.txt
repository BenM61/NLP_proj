Do do do
Do do do
Do do do
Do do do 

Let's get the party started
All born to stay up late
No one gets out of this one
No one gets out of this 

Got a life from life on TV
Two eyes that stay in my skull
Long enough to start believe
If you give it up they'll love you for it
Give them blood and they'll love you for it 

You're not my girl
You're just tired 

You're not my girl
You're just tired 

You're not my girl
You're just tired 

Do do do
Do do do
Do do do
Do do do 

Let's get the party started
All born to stay up late
No one gets out of this one
No one gets out of this 

You're not my girl
You're just tired

You're not my girl
You're just tired

You're not my girl
You're just tired 
You're just tired 

Give it up and they'll love you for it
Give them blood and they'll love you for it 
 
You're not my girl
You're just tired

You're not my girl
You're just tired

You're not my girl
You're just tired
You're just tired

Do do do
Do do do
Do do do
Do do do
