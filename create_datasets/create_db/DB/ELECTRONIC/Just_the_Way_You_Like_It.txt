You have been single for a long time
And I don't want to cramp your style
Still, you insist you want to settle down
But I know better, you can't change years over night
And asking that , I would never do
So here's the solution that comes to mind

[Chorus:]
I'll be your number one
you still can have your fun
whenever you need love
I will give it to you, just the way you like it
you keep your other girls
until you settle down
whenever you get bored
I will give it to you just the way you like it

Just the way you like it [Repeat x2]

If you plan on loving me for a lifetime
It doesn't matter what you do
With other girls, they just can't change your mind (oh no)
'cause when you tire of them, you'll come back to me
I won't tie you down
You can play around
'cause you know where the best love is found (right here)

[Chorus]
I'll be your number one
you still can have your fun
whenever you need love
I will give it to you, just the way you like it
you keep your other girls
until you settle down
whenever you get bored
I will give it to you just the way you like it
