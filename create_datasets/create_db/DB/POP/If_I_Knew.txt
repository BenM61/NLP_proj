You know that you came at the perfect time
There was a mountain I had to claim as mine
And you brought every weather from storm to shine
But I'm thankful for who you helped me fight

Baby, if I knew what I know now
I would never turn it back around
Wrong or right, you held me up to the light
The mountain had a mirror inside
And where I was going took time

And you've seen me walk through a veil of fire
Stroll up by the darkness as my pain flew high
And I thought it was you I'd been searching for
Somehow I am a mirror, the mountain a door

Baby, if I knew what I know now
I could never turn it back around
Wrong or right, you held me up to the light
The mountain had a mirror inside
And where I was going took time
