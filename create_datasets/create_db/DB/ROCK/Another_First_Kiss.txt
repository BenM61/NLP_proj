I'm asleep but she's talking to me
She's walking 'round wearing all of my clothes
As she runs out of things to say
And grabs my coat to walk away

"How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
"How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How 'bout another first kiss?

Other people were too sentimental
And always worrying about their hair
Got tired of wasting all of my time
Now I'm not worrying at all

"How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
"How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How 'bout another first kiss?

I could tell you "We belong together."
And I could tell you "You belong with me."
But we've run out of things to say
And we'll be happy anyway so

"How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
"How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How 'bout another first kiss?

"How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
"How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How 'bout another first kiss?
