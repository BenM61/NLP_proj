I've got a feeling that something is wrong
That look is telling me your not happy
We never listen to our favorite song
Do you remember the way you held me
No I won't let you work this love away
There was a time when you held me tight
Dreams of now and dreams of yesterday
Both have the heartache that you feel inside

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

So many times I look into your eyes
I see an image a man who's crying
You try to tell me, but I realize
It's had to make it, I'll keep on trying
Open up your heart let's get away
Just take my hand it will be alright
Leave all behind, come out ad play
We'll find the answer deep into the night

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

Memories of you and me
The many in love
Tell me I'll always be in paradise

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise
