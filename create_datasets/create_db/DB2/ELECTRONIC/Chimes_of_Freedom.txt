Well, far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll 
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashin' 
As majestic bells of boats struck shadows in the sun 
Sayin', it may be the chimes of freedom crashin'

Flashin' for the warriors whose strength is not to fight 
Flashin' for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight 
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night 
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Well, in the city's melted furnace unexpectedly we watched 
With faces hidden here while the walls were tightenin'
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain 
Dissolved into the wild bales of lightnin'

Yeah, tollin' for the rebel, yeah, tollin' for the raked 
Tollin' for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked 
Yeah, tollin' for the outcasts burnin' constantly at stakes 
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin' 

And then through a cloud-like curtain in a far off corner flashed 
There's a hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly liftin' 
Well, electric light still struck like arrows 
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin' 

Well, tollin' for the searching ones on this speechless, secret trail 
For the lonesome haunted lovers with too personal a tale 
And for each young heart for each channeled soul misplaced inside a jail 
Yeah, we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Well, starry eyed and laughin' I recall when we were caught 
Trapped by an old track of vows for the hands suspended 
As we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look 
Spellbound and swallowed "Has the tollin' ended?" 

Yeah, tollin' for the achin' ones whose wounds cannot be nursed 
For the countless, confused, accused, misused strung out ones at worst 
And for every hung out person in the whole wide universe 
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'
