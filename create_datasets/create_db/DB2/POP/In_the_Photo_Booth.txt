Let's go in the photo booth
Don't be shy, I know I've just met you
I like strangers who give me the eye
I'm gonna get crazy with you tonight
All I want is a little kiss
Just push the red button
And don't resist

Let's go in the photo booth
Lower the seat, let me sit on you
I wanna feel your hands around my waist
This is our secret that can't be traced
Count it down, see the camera flash
Pick up all the photos and put in more cash

I just saw this man in the crowd
Something made me want him right now
I said let's go in the photo booth
What makes me do the things that I do?

Please unzip my little black dress
Take off your shirt, I wanna feel your flesh
If I touch myself, does that make you hot?
You got me excited, I ain't gonna stop
We've got a minute so don't hesitate
There's people outside, and they don't wanna wait

I just saw this man in the crowd
Something made me what him right now
I said let's go in the photo booth
What makes me do the things that I do?

Boy, it's been nice meeting you
I must run, I have something to do
Now we're finished and the photos are done
I'll give them to you, now we've had our fun
Who knows if I'll see you again
This is the way the night's gonna end
