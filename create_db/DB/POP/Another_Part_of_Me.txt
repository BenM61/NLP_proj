We're takin' over
We have the truth
This is the mission to see it through
Don't point your finger
Not dangerous
This is our planet
You're one of us

We're sendin' out a major love
And this is our message to you (message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line waitin' for you
Can't you see?
You're just another part of me

Out from a nation
I feel the truth
The final message we'll bring to you
There is no danger to feel the truth
So come again
We need you

We're sendin' out a major love
And this is our message to you (message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line waitin' for you
So know the truth
You're just another part of me

We're sendin' out a major love
And this is our message to you (message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line waitin' for you
Can't you see?
You're just another part of me
Another part of me

We're taking over
This is the truth, baby
Another part of me
