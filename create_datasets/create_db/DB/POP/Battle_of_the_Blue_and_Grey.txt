Now it's gone ,gone , gone 
Those years have passed away 
It's gone , gone , gone 
There's truth in what I say 
It's gone , gone , gone 
There's nothing more to say 
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again 

Well, I'm an old man now and I'm born to win the race 
People won't believe me but there's truth in what I say 
Many hearts were broken and a lot of tears were shed 
The sky was black and the battlefield was red 

Now it's gone , gone , gone 
Those years have passed away 
It's gone , gone , gone 
There's truth in what I say 
It's gone , gone , gone 
There's nothing more to sa 
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again 

Now, Stonewall Jackson stepped right up and then he said to me 
He said "The battle's gettin' rough son, guess we better flee. 
There's grapeshot all around us and the field is black with lead. 
You better start a-runnin' boy before you lose your head " .

Well, the cannons roared around us and the field was black with lead 
I picked a soldier dressed in blue and filled him full of lead 
I picked out six more soldiers there a-sittin' on a mound 
I fixed my bayonet to my gun and really mowed them down 

Now, it's gone , gone , gone 
Those years have passed away 
It's gone , gone , gone 
There's truth in what I say 
It's gone , gone , gone 
There's nothing more to say
