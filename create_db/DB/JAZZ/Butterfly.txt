Goodbye is what she said
When she said I'm sorry
And I, I'm dying on the inside
'cause I tried but I can't hide the tears
That fall from my eyes

Hold me close one more night
Hold me close one more time
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside
A butterfly

hello with a little wink 
But what she think of me 
And oh she smiled
Give me her name
But who would have thought I would be crying here
With all this pain no no

Hold me close one more night baby
Hold me close one more time (just give me one more time my baby)
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside
A butterfly

Now there's nothing I can do and
There's nothing I can say
About losing you
I wish that I could find a way, wish that I could see you again
If only I could turn back time

Hold me close one more night...
Hold me close one more time.. 
Hold me close 'cause I'm dyin on the inside (dying on the inside)
A butterfly....
