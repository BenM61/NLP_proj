Fourteen people in the club 
I'ma robot, what no love 
Backstage she came rollin' up 
She said "do anything and I love you" 
Well there must be a mistake 
Girl you're way too hot 
You could make a million dollars with the face you got 
Don't you know my last album was a flop 
She said "do anything and I love you" 

Well, I don't do love letters 
I'm no good with flowers 
If I forget your birthday,
Will you still love me 

[Chorus]
What are the odds of 
One true love 
You say "high"
But I have my doubts 
What are the odds of 
Me letting you down 
Please don't cry it's just your love 
It creeps me out 

Now she can't stop from loving me 
Making me food, touching me 
I told her I ain't got money (ney) 
She said "do anything and I love you" yeah 
I know your mom makes fun of me 
And you caught your best friend under me 
I guess this means you're done with me 
She said "do anything and I love you" 
Well, I go out all hours 
You get strange phone calls 
I'm so A-D-D with you 
But, you still love me 

[Chorus]

You're creepin' me out 
She don't screw my friends 
And she cleans up my house 
All of this love girl, is creepin' me out 
She don't screw my friends 
And she cleans up my house 
All of this love girl, is creepin' me out 

[Chorus]

You're creepin' me out 
You're creepin' me out 
Girl, you're creepin' me out 
Girl, you creep me out
