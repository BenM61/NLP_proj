I never had a friend like you
This is the day
Your skin is white, your eyes are blue
This is the day

But the wind might change
I will still remain
I will always be there for you

A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha
These thoughts, they circle in my mind
This is the day
The demons I can't leave behind
This is the day

Don't be insecure
I'll be at your door
I will always be there for you

They will save you
They will save you
They will save you
Stay! Stay !Stay! Stay!

They will save you
They will save you
They will save you
Stay! Stay!
Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!

I have provoked thy grace into my mind
This is the day
I have provoked thy grace thou art divine
This is the day

Don't be insecure
I'll be at your door
I will always be there for you

They will save you
They will save you
They will save you
Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!

They will save you
They will save you
They will save you
Stay! Stay!
Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!

But the wind might change
I will still remain
I will still be here

But the wind might change
I will still remain
I will always be there for you

They will save you
They will save you
They will save you
Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!

They will save you
They will save you
They will save you
Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!

They will save you
They will save you
They will save you
Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!

They will save you
They will save you
They will save you
Stay! Stay!
Stay!
