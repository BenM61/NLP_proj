(uh-huh lookin' good)

Girl, I know it's hard to vibe
When you're working at your nine to five
So just, think of me, 'til you
Get off tonight

You'll be my lover
Sweet baby mother
There is no other who can bring me off 
Like you do
Under the covers
Baby mother
There ain't no other

Black pants suit, sexy pumps
Take me out to a power lunch
Tisk tisk baby with the bisk
A briefcase full of sexy tricks

Black pants suit, sexy pumps
Take me out to a power lunch
I appetize lookin' at your thighs
What's this touchin' my?

You'll be my lover
Sweet baby mother
There'll be no other who can bring me off 
Like you do
Under the covers
Baby mother
There ain't no other

Deeper deeper
I can feel ya beeper
Deeper deeper
I can feel ya beeper
Deeper deeper
I can feel ya beeper
Deeper deeper
I can feel ya beeper

Boy, I know you treat me best
When I'm sittin' at my desk
But the tricks you pulled last night
Put me to the test

Soak up and lather, baby father
There ain't no other who can break me off
Like you do
Under the water, baby father
There ain't no other

Black pants suit, sexy pumps
Take me out to a power lunch
Your name is sex in my Rolodex
I'm shaved so close you're tastin' wax

Black pants suit, sexy pumps
Take me out to a power lunch
Silk and lace in my database
Baby, I want to interface.
