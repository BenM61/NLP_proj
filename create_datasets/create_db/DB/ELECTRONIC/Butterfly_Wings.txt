You can't place faith in material things 
Material things will fail you 
A hurricane triggered by a butterfly's wings 
Your conspirators betray you 

Don't place faith in human beings 
Human beings are unreliable things 
Don't place faith in human beings 
Human beings or butterfly's wings 

You can't place faith in a new regime 
That fascist faith will kill you 
A hurricane triggered by a butterfly's wings 
Your conspirators betray you 

Don't place faith in human beings 
Human beings are unreliable things 
Don't place faith in human beings 
Human beings or butterfly wings 

There's something burning 
Deep inside I know 
There's something 
Inside this hole 

(Tonight when I chase the dragon - 
By their fruits you shall know them) 

Don't place faith 
Don't place faith 
When I decide to live in the mind 
The heart dies 
Mother superior in the sky 
The heart dies 
The heart dies 

Don't place faith in human beings 
Human beings are unreliable things 
Don't place faith in human beings 
Human beings or butterfly wings
