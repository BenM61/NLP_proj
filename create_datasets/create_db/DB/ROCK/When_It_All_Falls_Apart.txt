I'm having a day from hell
It was all going so well (before you came)
And you told me you needed space

With a kiss on the side my face (not again)
And not to mention (the tears, I shed)
But I should have kicked your (ass instead )
I need intervention
Attention to stop temptation to scream baby

Everything is 'f'ed' up straight from the heart
Tell me what do you do, when it all falls apart
Gotta pick myself up where do I start
'Cause I can't turn to you when it all falls apart
No

Don't know where I parked my car
Don't know who my real friends are (anymore)

I put my faith in you
What a stupid thing to do (when it rains it pours)
And not to mention (I drank too much)
I'm feeling hung over (and out of touch)
I need intervention

Attention to stop temptation to scream baby
Everything is 'f'ed' up straight from the heart
Tell me what do you do, when it all falls apart
Gotta pick myself up where do I start
'Cause I can't turn to you when it all falls apart

No
Can it be easier?

Can I just change my life?
Cause it just seems to go bad everytime
Will I be mending?
Another one ending once again

Everything is 'f'ed' up straight from the heart
Tell me what do you do, when it all falls apart
Gotta pick myself up where do I start
'Cause I can't turn to you when it all falls apart
No
