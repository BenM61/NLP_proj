Write a letter, write another letter
Write a letter, write another letter
Write a letter

I'm sealing up this letter
I just finished signing your name
My friends would all be surprised
If they knew I was playing this game

I'll pretend it's a special delivery
And just to give me a hint
I'll use your favorite color
Smear it with your favorite scent

Huh, I know you think that I'm crazy
But I can't loose, what have I left
So I've decided to write this letter
And send it to myself

So to make my story short
In the mail box I will place
This letter that I wrote
And it's stamped with your lovely face

When I'm alone
And I need someone to talk to
I talk to your picture
Get me a pencil and paper (Pencil and paper)

And write all the things
Say all the things
I've heard you say before
But with a little extra

(Extra, extra, read all about it)

Sugar and spice
I guess it makes me feel kind of nice
I write a letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)

(Write a letter, write another letter)

Oh...write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
I write a letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Oh...I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)

What is a home when you're all alone
It seems so full
It seems so full, but so empty
(Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...)

So I put my coat
Leave you a note
And go to the places, places, places where we used to be
I pretend you are there

Order dinner for two
Your every presence is all in the air
I write a letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)

I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Oh...I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter), mmm, hmm

I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)

(Write a letter, write another letter)
I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter), oh, yeah
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter(
(Write a letter, write another letter)

Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)

I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
Oh...I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter), mmm, hmm
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)

(Write a letter, write another letter)
Write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write a letter)
I write another letter (Write a letter) to myself (Write another letter)
(Write a letter, write another letter)
