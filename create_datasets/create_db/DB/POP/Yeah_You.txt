Stranger,
You ever stole a win off the jaws of defeat?
When its there for the taking you'll find me,
I'll be dancing all over its teeth.

We're never gonna know our place, you and me,
No we're not fitting in

And we know what we're doing,
And its too late to change now we've got the floor.
We've saved our time for living
And we aren't gonna take any shit anymore.
No we ain't gonna take any shit anymore,
So suck you're evil in.

You make changes,
You've always been too down on yourself for years.
You want a bow and take it.

But we free dinners kids with the big ideas,
We'll always take the stick while ignoring the fear
That we could give it in

And we know what we're doing,
And its too late to change now we've got the floor.
We've saved our time for living
And we aren't gonna take any shit anymore.
No we ain't gonna take any hit anymore,
So suck you're evil in.

Yeah you
Yeah you
Yeah you
Yeah you
Yeah you
Yeah you
Yeah you
