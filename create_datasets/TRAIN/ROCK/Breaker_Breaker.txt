Before you break my heart
Before you start
I'm gonna break your arm and concentration
Before you make a sound
And try to turn us down
I'm gonna stuff your mouth with all your riddles

I don't need your lovin'
But your words are digging through me like a knife
I'm trying to express a thing
I haven't got a clue about
I guess that's how it's done
You had to follow
If you didn't know the way around

Before you break my heart
Before you run
I'm gonna break your nose and sing about it

I don't need your lovin'
But your words are digging through me like a knife
I'm trying to express a thing
I haven't got a clue about
I guess that's how it's done
You had to follow
If you didn't know the way around

Before you break my heart
Before you break my heart
Before you break my heart
Before you break
