We lay awake, silent in the dark
You don't have to hide the trace
Emptiness left its mark

Ring of ice
Ring of ice 'round your heart
Ring of ice
Ring of ice, break apart

We are lonely people wearin' a ring of ice 

Dancin' in the night
Tryin' to disguise
All that lies behind
Countless empty lies
Wearing a ring of ice

I walk alone searchin' for a sign

Someone else must be alive with warmth behind their eyes
Ring of ice
Ring of ice 'round your heart
Ring of ice
Ring of ice, break apart

All the lonely people wearin' a ring of ice 

Dancin' in the night
Tryin' to disguise
All that lies behind
Countless empty lies
Wearing a ring of ice

All the lonely people wearing a ring of ice
Dancin' in the night
Tryin' to disguise 
All that lies behind surrounded by a ring of ice
Dancin' in the night
Tryin' to disguise 
All that lies behind surrounded by a ring of ice
Dancin' in the night
Tryin' to disguise
All that lies behind surrounded by a ring of ice
