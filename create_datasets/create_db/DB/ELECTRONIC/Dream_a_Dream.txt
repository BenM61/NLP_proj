Hooh, one more time I'm back with a new rhyme
Hey, here we go again. Ha, turn it up my friend
No, we don't stop. Ha, we rock the spot
No, we don't quit. Get ready ya'll this is it

Do you like this dream. Hey, I like this dream, baby
Do you like this dream. Hoo, I like this dream, mama
Do you like this stream. Hey, I like the stream, baby
Do you like this stream. Hoo, so scream it out

Dream a dream, lover take me in your dream
Take me any way you please
Boy you're making me scream
Dream a dream, lover live is just dream

If you want to set me free
Boy you're making me scream
Ooh la-da-di, la-da-da.
Take me anyway you please,

Boy you're making me scream
Ooh la-da-di, la-da-da.
You gotta dream a little dream

Uuh, party over here. Ha, bring it up from the rear
Uuh, party over there. Ha, hands in the air
No, we don't stop. Ha, we rock the spot
No, we don't quit. Get ready y'all this is it
