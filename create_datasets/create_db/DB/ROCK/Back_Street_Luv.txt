Some whirls come in time to dream the day away  And she's so sunny is the girl you met today  Will she make it can she take it  Like to try love such a shy love    Racket back street leanin' an the wall  She reads a story of her life before a doll  Did she give love could she feel love  Did she find love was t real love.    * When you smile today  Did she let you  Try to seize you didn't mean to  Make you feel so sad    Racket back street sittin' on the wall  She tells a man back she few before a doll  When she made love she try to find love  When She gives love she will find love
