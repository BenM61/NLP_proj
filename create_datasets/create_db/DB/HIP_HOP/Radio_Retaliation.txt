Woah now, retaliation
Singing woah now, we a go wake up the nation
Radio retaliation, it's such a different corporation
We taking over your station and we a go change the vibration

People fi get up and pump them fist when sleepy talk
Hear mi transmission whether you drive or whether you walk
Put up me antenna inna the middle of the park
And transmit mi signal inna the light and inna the dark

Radio retaliate, and never ever get caught
And change the stereotype of people's wash over thoughts
Fifty thousand watts of Thievery hit them like poison darts
And watch the whole system what them build up fall apart

Singing woah now retaliation
Singing woah now, we a go wake up the nation
Radio retaliation, it's such a different corporation
We taking over your station and we a go change the vibration

Mi have the basic qualification, just fi get people straight
And juggle the microphone from eight o'clock back to eight
People give me the recommendation from the musical senate
Fi juggle the roundest sound, the mellowest sound
The sound with the most weight

Them stand up out of the corner, inna the driveway, outta mi gate
To hear the chief rocker them a fling dubplate
All who want fi challenge Thievery, then it's your time fi wait
And re-emerge from the scene, and wipe away all the hate

Radio retaliation, it's such a different corporation
We taking over your station and we a go change the vibration

Chief rocker Thievery Corp them pon the attack
With melody and sophistication make you bound have to rock
Sleepy wonder deh pon the mic, the ragga muffin speed rap
And if your vibes is inna the gutter, I will lift it up to the top

Eric and Rob them produce the beat, and invite Sleepy down fi chat
The combination of the crew, destroy your whole habitat
The main objection of the track is to tear the whole place flat
And have the people inna the lounge
Them want to get up, and they are singing

Woah now retaliation
Singing woah now, we a go wake up the nation
Radio retaliation, it's such a different corporation
We taking over your station and we a go change the vibration boy
