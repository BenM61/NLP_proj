I know you thought that you were unsatisfied
That you would never change your mind
Though things like this never happen with you
You're not a prisoner, you know what to do

If you could fly, or collapse all of the time
Then nothing stands in your way
But as you can't, 
It's not question of fight
That was over when you came up here tonight
