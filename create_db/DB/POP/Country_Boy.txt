Never gonna kiss those ruby red lips
Of the sweetest girl in town.
I'm never gonna ask her if she'll marry me
'Cause I know she'll turn me down.

Because I'm just a country boy
And money have I none
Oh but I've got silver, silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun

Never could afford no store-bought ring
With a sparkly diamond stone.
All I have to offer is a love that's true,
It's the only one I own.

And I'm just a country boy
And money, money have I none.
Oh but I've got silver, silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun.

Ain't gonna marry in the fall,
Never gonna marry in the spring
'Cause I am in love with a pretty little girl
That wears a diamond ring.

And I'm, I'm just a country boy
And money, money have I none.
Oh but I've got silver, silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun.
