I believe in the world
When I see the beauty in a girl like you
And I believe that all my dreams of yesterday
Are one touch away

[Chorus]
want to be your final destination (I want to be your town)
want to be the station where you jump off the train
Let's make a story about you and me
This love is meant to be

I believe that life
Is giving back to you what you sacrifice
All the tears I cry disappear with the love I see
Right next to me

[Chorus]
