Making me so hot,
Oh yeah we hit the spot,
Yeah you and the music is all that I got,
Oh oh oh,
Turn it on, turn it on,
I wrote it for you,
You're the title of my song,
Me and my,

Me and my (microphone),

We've been around the world with our disco beat,
We're floating on a feeling (of believing),
Rocking from Paris to Fuji,
