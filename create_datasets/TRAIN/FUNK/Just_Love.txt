You can run. you can run. you can run,
But there's no hiding place.
You can't deny it. don't try to fight it.

We love you and there is nothing you can ever do about it
If you get off track, turn around and come right back
We love you and there is nothing you can ever do about it
If you lose your way, you still got a place to stay so

Touch somebody and
Find out that they understand
When you tell 'em what you been through,
Who you are, what you had to do.
Believe it when you hear them say
The god we serve has made a way
For you to lay your burden down
Rest and make a joyful sound

We love you and there is nothing you can ever do about it
If you get off track, turn around and come right back
We love you and there is nothing you can ever do about it
If you lose your way, you still got a place to stay so

Hug somebody now
Hold tight and just let it out
Somebody's gonna stand right here
Until you can move past your fear (or 'and wipe away every tear')
And if you need a friend
Don't wait outside. come on in.
But even if you need some time
Don't rush. it will be alright because

We love you and there is nothing you can ever do about it
If you get off track, turn around and come right back
We love you and there is nothing you can ever do about it
If you lose your way, you still got a place to stay so

So just love. no fear
Love. no fear.
Love. love. love. love. love.

Ooh child you look like my sister on my father's side
Ooh child you look like my brother on my father's side
