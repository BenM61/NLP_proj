Have you heard who's kissing him now
Do you think he's blue
Did he say we're through
Has he found someone new

Have you seen the way he looks now
Does he act the same when he hears my name
Does he say who's to blame
My arms are empty
My nights are long and lonely
I miss him so
Each new tomorrow can only bring me sorrow
I love him so

Have you heard of their wedding day
Rumors come and go
Still I'd like to know
If it's true won't you tell me
Have you heard

Have you heard of their wedding day
Rumors come and go
Still I'd like to know
If it's true won't you tell me
Have you heard
