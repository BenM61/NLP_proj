I took a double take out on the interstate
When I saw her makin' eyes at me
So I followed her down the clubhouse drive
Past the pool and the 18th green
And in the parkin' lot
I said it's mighty hot
Maybe I could buy you a beer
She said I'm glad you asked
But I'll have to pass
'Cause only members are allowed in here
And I said

I'm a member of a country club
Country music is what I love
I drive an old Ford pick-up truck
I do my drinkin' from a Dixie cup
Hey I'm a bonafide dancin' fool
I shoot a mighty mean game of pool
At any honky-tonk roadside pub
I'm a member of a country club

Lord, you look so invitin'
Thought it might be excitin'
For a woman with a limousine
To go bouncin' around in a beat up truck
With a man in wore out jeans
It's five o'clock before Friday night
Here's where the fun begins
So don't worry 'bout your reputation
'Cause you can tell all your friends

I'm a member of a country club
Country music is what I love
I drive an old Ford pick-up truck
I do my drinkin' from a Dixie cup
Hey I'm a bonafide dancin' fool
I shoot a mighty mean game of pool
At any honky-tonk roadside pub
Well I'm a member of a country club

Yeah I'm a member of a country club
Country music is what I love
I drive an old Ford pick-up truck
I do my drinkin' from a Dixie cup
Hey I'm a bonafide dancin' fool
I shoot a mighty mean game of pool
At any honky-tonk roadside pub
Well I'm a member of a country club
At any honky-tonk roadside pub
Well I'm a member of a country club
