Am I right or wrong?
'Cause I risk it all to make you miss me babe
If I let it go then baby you'll never the time that we waste
And you promise me you would change, well never do
But I stay with you, I stay with you

I'll never be the first to call
Make you believe we got it all
I'll be the girl to break your heart
I get it from you
I'll tell you jump and watch you fall
Play with you like a barbie doll
Say I love you then I break it off
I get it from you, yeah

Oh I might as well just lay here with you
Since you beg me not to go
Between faded walls
Late at night is that your boss who calls, huh?
And if I overthought or maybe I'm too involved
Correct me if I'm wrong

I'll never be the first to call
Make you believe we got it all
I'll be the girl to break your heart
I get it from you
I tell you jump and watch you fall
Play with you like a barbie doll
Say i love you then I break your heart
I get it from you, yeah

I'll never be the first to call
Make you believe we got it all
I'll be the girl to break your heart
I get it from you
I tell you jump and watch you fall
Play with you like a barbie doll
Say I love you then I break your heart
I get it from you, yeah

I'll never be the first to call
Make you believe we got it all
I'll be the girl to break your heart
I get it from you
I tell you jump and watch you fall
Play with you like a barbie doll
Say I love you then I break your heart
I get it from you, yeah
