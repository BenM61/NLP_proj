If you look into your heart 
With a positive mind 
Take self inventory of your woman and your glory 

Leave the bad things behind (ooh) 
Everybody's got a story (yes they do) 
About love and the good things 
But for the spices of your life 
You got to pay the price 

If you know what I mean (ooh yeah) 
Telling everybody, out loud
How a girl becomes some proud
When thought there was nothing left 
I do believe I found myself 

And I want to give it to you baby oh yes I do (yeah yeah) 
So if you look into your heart 
With a positive mind 

You can take self inventory of your woman and your glory 
Leave the bad things behind

He really loves me we don't have that everyday (oh no no no)
