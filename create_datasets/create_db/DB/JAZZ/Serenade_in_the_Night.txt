Serenade in the night 'neath a fair lady's window
Just the same serenade that I tenderly played on a night long ago
There were stars in the sky and I sang 'neath the roses
But she gave not a sign that she'd ever be mine and my love story closes
Oh! why must the south wind be bringing it?
Oh! why must my heart keep on singing it?
Serenade in the night from the past comes to haunt me
