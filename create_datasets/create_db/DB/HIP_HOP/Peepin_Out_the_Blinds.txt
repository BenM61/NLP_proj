Gato, ha
They come to my chart
Take my shit, you should post too
Ka, ba, gato

Firing at niggas, I'm firing at niggas
I'm firing at niggas outside
I feel like Malcolm X, I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm coming out firing at niggas
Firing at niggas
I hear sirens, I'm firing
I'm firing with that niggas
I'm like Malcolm X, I'm peepin' out the blinds
Care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm coming out

Bow, bow, bow
Man down, click clack
Who your man now, know you heard 'bout Gucci Mane than what 'bout lettin' that thang sound
You stunt on Instagram, I'm in a rental van now
Don't know how this shit gon' turn, but I won't run my mouth
Nigga run up on me, I'ma back his ass down
I'ma stand up nigga, I will never lay down
A bad place by the cartel, they gon' knock his head down
One thing 'bout them eskimos, them boys don't f*ck around
Jamaican plugs and Mexicans, they spoilin' me with pounds
Medellin affiliated, grow it out the ground
We grow it out the ground

Boston George, Diego flow, my bitch like risotto dough
Thousand pounds of yellow dough, rich ass jacket full of money
Cameras watchin' every dope
Ten mil in an envelope, banana boat with telescope but count two mil on Periscope
Duplex is a sectional, burglar bars protect the dough
Draco wanna flow an AR, fifteen on the sectional
A young nigga with plenty dough, I dun' hit so many hoes
Eenie meenie miney hoe, I always use protection though
My Smith and Wesson teach a lesson, whatchu call your brother for?
You ain't even special hoe, why you gettin' all extra for?
Why that nigga pull up to my trap back in  aggresive form
I blast you out and stress you, if it's pressure then it's pressure
