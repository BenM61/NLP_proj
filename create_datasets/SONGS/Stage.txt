I want to feel 
I want to try 
I want to rock in the city tonight 
I want to deal 

Don't want to die 
I want to bring my captain hook into the light 
People I've seen my day 
Ranting and raving this beauty away 

We are by and large the same 
But words are too feeble they cannot contain 
He was a rock and roll messiah
She was known for her child care 

The truth is gonna give up the world 
If you can give up the stage 
If I can give up the stage 
If we can give up the stage 

Come to this, I can't come to you 
Don't do this, wake me up tonight 
Come to this, I can't come to you 
Don't do this, wake me up tonight
