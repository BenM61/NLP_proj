When I became of age my mother called me to her side,
She said,"Son, you're growing up now pretty soon you'll take a bride.
And then she said, "Just because you've become a young man now,
There's still somethings that you don't understand now,
Before you ask some girl for her hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now."

My mama told me, "You better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around." (shop, shop around)

Ah, there's somethings that I want you to know now.
Just as sure as the winds gonna blow now
The women come and the women gonna go now
Before you tell em that you love em so now.

My mama told me, "You better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around." (shop, shop around)

A-try to get yourself a bargain son.
Don't be sold on the very first one.
A-pretty girls come a dime a dozen,
A-try to find one who's gonna give you true lovin'

Before you take a girl and say I do, now,
Make sure she's in love with-a you now.
My mama told me, "You better shop around."

Ooh yeah, a-try to get yourself a bargain son.
Don't be sold on the very first one.
A-pretty girls come a dime a dozen,
A-try to find one who's gonna give you true lovin'.

Before you take a girl and say I do, now,
Make sure she's in love with-a you now.
Make sure that her love is true now.
I hate to see you feelin' sad and blue now."

My mama told me, "You better shop around (shop, shop)
Don't let the first one get you
Oh no cause I don't want to see her with you
Before you let her hold you tight, ah yeah make sure shes alright
Before you let her take your hand my son
Understand my son, be a man my son I know you can I love you"
