In the constellation of Cygnus
There lurks a mysterious, invisible force
The Black Hole of Cygnus X-1 

Six stars of the northern cross
In mourning for their sister's loss
In a final flash of glory
Nevermore to grace the night

Invisible
To telescopic eye
Infinity
The star that would not die 

All who dare
To cross her course
Are swallowed by
A fearsome force 

Through the void
To be destroyed
Or is there something more?
Atomized, at the core
Or through the astral door
To soar

I set a course just east of Lyra
And northwest of Pegasus
Flew into the light of Deneb
Sailed across the Milky Way 

On my ship, the 'Rocinante'
Wheeling through the galaxies,
Headed for the heart of Cygnus
Headlong into mystery 

The x-ray is her siren song
My ship cannot resist her long
Nearer to my deadly goal
Until the black hole
Gains control

Spinning, whirling
Still descending
Like a spiral sea
Unending 

Sound and fury
Drowns my heart
Every nerve
Is torn apart
