The ball without the game
The link without the chain
A face without a name
No need to be ashamed

So here we are, baby
We both know it's feelin' crazy
I dare you to stop at nothing tonight

Ooh, you're walkin' a tight rope
Why don't you wanna let go
And fall into the sublime?
You got this fear of flyin'

My body's on fire
I think it's about that time
Ya let it go into overdrive
(Come on, baby)

Ooh, don't you wanna taste it
Touch it and stimulate it
'Til I can feel it deep inside
Don't be so uptight
(You know it feels right)

If your energy
Explodes all on me
Just indulge in pleasure
Set our bodies free

Get lost in all of this love
Soft to the touch
I'm every inch a woman
Don't be shy

Feel me, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands on
(Touch me)

The ball without the game
The link without the chain
A face without a name
No need to be ashamed

It's cool to be shy
But don't let it pass you by
Just give up and let your senses go
(Go)

Ooh, you know I wanna feel ya
Come here a little nearer
And let the fantasy unfold
(Ya know)

If your energy
Explodes all on me
Just indulge in pleasure
Set our bodies free

Get lost in all of this love
Soft to the touch
I'm every inch a woman
Don't be shy

Feel me, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands on

It's cool to be shy, baby
Just stimulate me
Don't you wanna touch it
You know you wanna taste it

Let your senses go
Let the fantasy unfold
Put your hands on
Oh yeah

If your energy
Explodes all on me
Just indulge in pleasure
Set our bodies free

Get lost in all of this love
Soft to the touch
I'm every inch a woman
Don't be shy

Feel me, come on
