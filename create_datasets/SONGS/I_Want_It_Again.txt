You know it's been so long 
Since we've played hide and seek 
You know I've never played 
That way 
Kind of freaky 

Sexy curiousity went to our heads 
We were both curious like a cat 
So we both had a sexy death 
Hey 

Ooops 
Head on body collision 
Don't even think about body division 
Ever since you showed me this feeling 
I want it inside 
Of every evenin 

I know its been along time 
But if you don't mind 
Give me a sign 
So I ain't outta line 
I gotta tell you my friend 


I want it again 
Again and again 
I want it again 
Again and again 

Bridge: 

You've got me shook (You've got me whooped) 
Severely whooped (severely hooked) 
You've got me whooped (severely shooked) 
Severely shooked 

Verse: 

It's real simple 
Popped like a pimple 
You know we had a good time 
And ever since it's been on my mind 
I merely wanna lay you down 
Then roll around the town 
Just never told you how I really feel 
So here's the deal
