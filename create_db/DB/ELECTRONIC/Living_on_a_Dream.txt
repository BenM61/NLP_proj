Living on a dream 
Sometimes 

Make my day with a single touch 
Make me stay, don't give up 
I've no control when it comes to you 
Make my day baby won't you 
A single touch is all I need 
Don't give up baby don't retreat 
I've no defense when it comes to you 
make my day baby won't you 

[Chorus]
I'm living on a dream 
Or so it seems 
Sometimes 
Living on a dream 
No milk, just cream 
Sometimes bells chime 

T-t-t-toe to toe 
Cheek to cheek 
You get close 
And I get weak 

Don't shoot me down with your baby blues 
Make my day darling won't you 
Your baby blues call my name 
You won't hear my heart complain 

Hang with me and we'll do the do 
Make my day baby won't you 

[Chorus: x 2] 

Living on a dream 
Sometimes 

[Chorus: x 2] 

Living on a dream - repeat to fade
