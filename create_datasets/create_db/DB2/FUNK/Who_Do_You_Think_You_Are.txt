Who am I?
I'm just a guy who only wants to try
To do what's right and never make you cry
But you're no good to me, and

Who do you think you are?
You try to push me a bit too far
And every day sees another scar
Tell me, who do you think you are?
If you want me there, you gotta care
Who do you think you are, taking advantage of me this way?
Who do you think you are, hurting me more with everything you say?
It's not fair, you don't care
Who do you really think that you are?

Where are we?
We're at the crossroads and I just can't see
Which road to take to keep you here with me
The lights are down and baby,

Who do you think you are?
You try to push me a bit too far
And every day sees another scar
Tell me, who do you think you are?
If you want me there, you gotta care
Who do you think you are, taking advantage of me that way?
Who do you think you are, hurting me with everything you say?
It's not fair, you don't care
Who do you really think that you are?

Who am I?
I'm just a guy who only wants to try
To do what's right and never make you cry
But you're no good to me, and

Who do you think you are?
You try to push me a bit too far
And every day sees another scar
Tell me, who do you think you are?

Yeah, baby, who do you think you are?
You try to push me a bit too far
And every day sees another scar
Tell me, who do you think you are?
