If lust and hate is the candy
if blood and love tastes so sweet
then we give 'em what they want
Hey, hey, give 'em what they want

So their eyes are growing hazy 'cause they want to turn it on
so their minds are soft and lazy
Well, hey, give 'em what they want

If lust and hate is the candy
if blood and love tastes so sweet
then we give 'em what they want

So their eyes are growing hazy 'cause they want to turn it on
so their minds are soft and lazy
Well who do you want to blame?
