I'm in heavy I'm in deep 
I look cool but inside I weep 
I'm older but sure ain't as wise 
As I pretend to it's mostly all lies 
I'm a liar I'm a cheat 
Sore loser can't stand defeat 
I say I'm right but I know I'm wrong 
Just want my music when you're playing your songs 

I know it doesn't show 
But it's time I let you know 
Hopeless case of a kid in denial 

Got my tongue firmly in cheek 
Make up my mind just after I speak 
I should do it but I don't 
I say I will but you just know I won't 
You like the "Fabs" I dig "The Who" 
You eat tikka I eat vindaloo 
I only drink when I want to forget 
I won't admit it but I do regret 

I know it doesn't show 
But it's time I let you know 
Hopeless case of a kid in denial 

I'm in deep I'm in real heavy 
Can't kick it even though I try 
I feel sick but I don't want you to heal me 
I'm a hopeless case of a kid in denial 

Yeah I'm a liar and I'm a cheat 
Real sore loser can't stand defeat 
There ain't a thing that'll pass my rejection 
Getting real close to denial perfection 

I know it doesn't show 
But it's time I let you know 
Hopeless case of a kid in denial
