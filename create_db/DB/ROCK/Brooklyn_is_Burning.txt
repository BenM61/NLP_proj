You strangle people with a pissing stare.
I can't believe I made it.
The way you operate is so severe,
So severe.  I hate it.
 
You strangle people with a sneering grin.
I can't believe I made it.
Brooklyn is burning down the discotheque, discotheque.
Let's shake it.
 
I feel the fire tonight.
I hear, I hear the people cry.
I see all the people laugh
I got, I got what the people want.
 
You send a message in the atmosphere
And everyone starts running.
The way you operate is so severe
So severe, so cunning.
 
You send a message in your beady stare
And everyone starts running.
Brooklyn is burning in the fire's side
Fire's side.
We're dancing.
 
I feel the fire tonight.
I hear, I hear the people cry.
I see all the people laugh.
I got, I got what the people want.
 
You strangle people with a pissing stare.
I can't believe I made it.
The way you operate is so severe, so severe.
I hate it.
 
You strangle people with a sneering grin.
I can't believe I made it.
Brooklyn is burning down the discotheque.
Let's shake it.
 
I feel like fire tonight.
I hear, I hear the people cry.
I see all the people laugh
I got, I got what the people want.
I got, I got what the people want.
