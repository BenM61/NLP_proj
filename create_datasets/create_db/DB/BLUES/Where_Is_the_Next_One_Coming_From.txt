Well I had a job, but I got laid off
I had a heart but it got too soft
I had a girlfriend and she lied
I had a wife but my wife she died

One too many drinks about an hour ago
All I want now's just one more
And when it hit, a baby I don't care
Where (where)
Where (where)
Where (where)
Oh where

Where is the next one comin' from
Where is the next one comin' from

Some folks they say there's just one thing (where is the next one comin' from)
Gonna make 'em dance and gonna make 'em sing (where is the next one comin' from)
Had a little o that and had a little of this (where is the next one comin' from)
Well I checked 'em all off 'a my list (where is the next one comin' from)

All I know is don't get enough
All I get is this old rough stuff
But when I do oh baby, I don't care
Where (where)
Where (where)
Where (where)
Oh where
Where is the next one comin' from
Where is the next one comin' from

I want more, gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Oh yeah I want more, oh oh yeah

(where is the one comin' from)
(where is the one comin' from)
(where is the one comin' from)

All I want is my belly full (where is the next one comin' from)
It's a natural thing for an animal (where is the next one comin' from)
Well I'm tired all of that give and take (where is the next one comin' from)

About all I got was a bellyache
And once a kid has come to town
He talked like a fool and he dressed like a clown
Only love could have put him down

Where (where)
Where (where)
Where (where)
Oh where

Where is the next one comin' from
Where is the next one comin' from

Where Oh, where huh (where is the next one comin' from)
Got to know , got to know, got to know, got to know about the next one, yeah

(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
(where is the next one comin' from)
