Do you want to go
To the plague with me?
I'm going down-down-down
There for the morning,
Most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Calm down-down-down,
My love is calling.

Come over here with your heart
And I will love your heart with mine.

There for the morning,
Most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Calm down-down-down,

It's half-past the moonlight.
Nobody would see us go.
(And I wonder) If...
Maybe you will look into my eyes
And you will see just what you done to me.

Time is short. You know you live one life.
It was love at first sight.
And being by your side is the only thing on my mind

Come over here with your heart
And I will love your heart with mine.

So do you want to go
To the plague with me?

There for the morning,
Most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Calm down-down-down,
My love is calling.
