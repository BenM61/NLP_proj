Standin' on my pillow
Talkin' to the moon
Wadin' in the ocean
I'm sendin' for you soon

Reachin' for the handle
Achin' in my head
Woven in the bedsheets
And then I will understand

Yeah!

Sun comes over the city
Time goes in its hand
Politicians are screamin'
There's a time and a little to spare

Leanin' out of the window
Runnin' from the gun
Caught in webs of invention
It's the blood, it's the blood of the sun

Hidin' in the ocean
With the sunshine at my side
To leave the hard road behind me
There's a light on the road that I ride

Thunder down in the valley
Rainbow 'round the moon
To leave the city behind me
I'm sendin' for you soon
Yeah, I'm sendin' for you soon
