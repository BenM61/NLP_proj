Summer journeys to Niagara and to other places
Aggravate all our cares, we'll save our fares
I've a cozy little flat in what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down right here in town

We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the zoo
It's very fancy on old Delancy Street, you know
The subway charms us so, when balmy breezes blow to and fro

And tell me what street compares with Mott Street in July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by
The great big city's a wondrous toy just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers where true love conquers in the whiles
And starve together, dear, in Chiles
We'll go to Coney and eat baloney on a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll, where our first kiss we stole, soul to soul

And "My Fair Lady" is a terrific show, they say
We both may see it close some day
The city's glamor can never spoil the dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy
