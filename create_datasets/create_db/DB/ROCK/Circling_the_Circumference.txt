All around the alphabet
To hide a sadder tale of someone sad at
Circling the circumference
Show me the way from the periphery

But everybody is wrapped
In a warm embrace
With their arms around the answers
While I'm wrapped up
In my own rigamarole because

I can't have that in my life
But soon I'll find
I won't have that in my life

Right or righteous? - I can't say
Another day, another dilemma
Don't have the time, thirst, wish, itch
Or urge to fit
Or that's my story and I am
Stuck with it!

I can't have that in my life
But soon I'll find
I won't have that in my life

You're deep in conversation
Where you really swim
And in the shallow water
I'm the first one in

A straight-forward answer
Is out of the question
Why her whole body joins in
In the way she smiles but
It's all too much of a muchness for me

I can't have that in my life
But soon I'll find
I won't have that in my life

I'm the man who missed a sitter
The pearly-gate crasher
The king's new clothes hanger
Skeptic kind of sucker

Straight man gone solo
Drunk or canned laughter
I'm sorry -
What was the question again?
