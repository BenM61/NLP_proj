To the window
Of my eyes
I can see
The rainey day
Sitting in a chair
Of my home
Looking for a way
To be the one who I am
It's useless to cry
For the things I want to know
Thinking  it will come back
And reach my home
It's like a distance
Like a distance face
It's like a shadow
Om my wall
Something that
I can't touch
I am heavenly
There's a cause
Shelter of my mind
Hides my love and my tear 
I keep on looking
For the reason which is not here

To the window
Of my eyes
I can see
The rainy day
Sitting in a chair
Of my home
Looking for a way
To be the one who I am
It's useless to cry
For the things I want to know
Thinking  it will come back
And reach my home
