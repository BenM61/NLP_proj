Bluebird, please, take this letter down south for me
Oh, bluebird, take this letter down south for me
Don't you two stop flyin' till you find little Liza Belle for me

Lord, she way down, she's way down in Jackson, Tennessee
Bluebird, she's way down south in Jackson, Tennessee
She may not be home, but, please, knock upon her door

Bluebird, bluebird, please, do this for me
Oh, bluebird, please, do this for me
If you see my baby, tell her I want her to come back home to me
