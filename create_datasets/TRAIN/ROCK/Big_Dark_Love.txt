I sit at my table
I drink from my cup
I gaze down the stairwell
Flip through the telephone book
I spit out the window
Oh, it hit someone
Isn't that fun
But it's not enough

I got the bends
I got the shakes
It never ends
It always aches
In the night
In the cold
It comes on
Pain like a searing light
Cuts like a dull knife
Are you awake
Can I come over tonight

I know it's a big dark love

Let me in
Me and my love
