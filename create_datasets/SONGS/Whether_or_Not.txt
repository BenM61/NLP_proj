Whether you like a storm breaking
Or whether you don't
There's still one thing
You have to say to me
Maybe you won't

But every time it feels like lightning
It's not easy to pretend
And I don't want to lay it all on a line
If you can't believe me
And I don't want to say, I love you all the time
If you don't need me

Whether I'm like a storm breaking
Or whether I'm not
It seems I'm in this tree
Nearly all my life
But you see maybe I'm not

But every time it feels like lightning
It's not easy to pretend
And all this fire in the air
Isn't mine not mine completely
But I let it light me every day of my life
So I can be me

Time in itself means nothing to me
Time is on the wall
There's nothing you can do
To stop the dance in you
Sometimes it's run, walk, crawl

And every time it feels like lightning
It's not easy to pretend
And I don't want to lay it all on a line
If you can't believe me
And I don't want to say, I love you all the time
If you don't need me

Whether you like a storm breaking
Or whether you don't
There's still one thing
You have to say to me
Maybe you won't

And every time it feels like lightning
It's not easy to pretend
And I don't want to lay it all on a line
If you don't believe me
And I don't want to say, I love you all the time
If you don't need me

And I don't want to lay it all on a line
If you can't believe me
And I don't want to say, I love you all the time
If you don't need me
