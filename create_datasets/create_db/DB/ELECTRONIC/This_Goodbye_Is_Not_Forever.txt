Baby, you can trust me 
You're not a one night stand with me
And if you got my message 
Oh you will be too blind to see 
Baby I will never go, baby I will never go 
Oh I swear it's true 
Baby I will never go, baby I will never go 
Never make you blue 

This goodbye is not forever 
I will love you forever and forever 
This goodbye is just in love to me 

Babe I die for you, girl. It's never just too late to try 
Oh the secret that you keep, girl 
Oh I see it in your eyes
Baby I will never go, baby I will never go... 

I can't let you go no no 'cause I need you so 
And I can't stop loving you
Can't stop loving you, girl, no, no, no, no
