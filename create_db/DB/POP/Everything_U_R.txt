All I need is
Everything you are
(Everything you are
Everything you are
Everything you are)

Love can be complicated
Too often mistranslated
One word for all dynamics
Leads to problematic
Emotions and affections

Feelings in all directions
Sometimes a simple action
Creates satisfaction
And as long as you are mine

I will take the time
To let you know
What I feel 'cause

[Chorus]
All I need
Is everything you are
Complete
And if you ever fall
I'll be here
Standing in the
Shadow of my heart

Cherish is lost to chatter
Mind games over matter
I'm not looking for suggestions
More answers with questions
I speak in hugs and kisses

'Cause true love never misses
I will lead or follow
To be with you tomorrow
And as long as you are mine
I will take the time
To let you know
What I feel 'cause

[Chorus]
There's nothing you
Could ever say, boy
(There's nothing
You could ever do)
To make me want to walk away
And as long as you are mine
I will remind myself
That this love is real

[Chorus: x 3]
