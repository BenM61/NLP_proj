I pray for peace 
Blessings and honor 
Heaven right earth's despair 
This is my Christmas prayer 

For those that grieve 
God will bring comfort 
Laughter will rapture there 
This is my Christmas prayer 

See I pray that love will rule and reign 
And I pray that time will rid the pain of this world 
As we learn to trust and care 
This is my Christmas prayer 

I pray for you (Yes I know you do) 
That your triumph and conquer 
Poses the strength you need to bare 
This is my Christmas prayer 

For those in need 
There would be plenty 
And each other's burdens share 
Oh, this is my Christmas prayer 

See I pray that love will rule and reign 
And I pray that time will rid the pain of this world 
As we learn to trust and care 
This is my Christmas prayer, oh 

So let hope fill our hearts (Let's let hope fill our hearts) 
Shine the light through the dark 
All around the world 
And everywhere 
I will pray 
This Christmas prayer 

See I pray that love will rule and reign 
And I pray that time will rid the pain of this world 
As we learn to trust and care 
This is my Christmas 
This is my Christmas prayer 

See I pray that love will rule and reign 
And I pray that time will rid the pain of this world 
As we learn to trust and care 
This is my Christmas prayer 
This is my Christmas prayer 

Merry Christmas Rob 
Merry Christmas BeBe
