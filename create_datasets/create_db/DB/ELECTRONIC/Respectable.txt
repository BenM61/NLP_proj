Take or leave us
Only please believe us

We ain't ever gonna be respectable
It's our occupation
We're a dancing nation

We keep the pressure on every nigh
Explanations are complications

We don't need to know the where or why
Taking chances
Bold advances

Don't care if you think we're out of line
Conversation is interrogation

Get out of here
We just don't have the time

Take or leave us
Only please believe us

We ain't ever gonna be respectable
Like us
Hate us
But you'll never change us

We ain't ever gonna be respectable
Hesitation is just frustration
Give us the music and we're all right
On each occasion
For your information

We can look after ourselves all right
Take or leave us
Only please believe us

Fascination is our sensation
We like to put ourselves on the line
Recreation is our destination

So don't wait up for us tonight
Take or leave us
Only please believe us

Take or leave us
Only please believe us
