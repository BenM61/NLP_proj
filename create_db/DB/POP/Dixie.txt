It started in fun, I needed someone
And now the hurt has begun
I was lonely and it all started in fun
She had left me and I needed just anyone

So it happened to be you
Someone I can tell my troubles to
And now we've gone too far, the hurt has begun
And I can't trust me in your arms anymore

It's not just another thrill like before
Every time your lips touch mine
We get closer all the time
And I can't trust me in your arms anymore

It started in fun, I needed someone
And now the hurt has begun
And I can't trust me in your arms anymore

It's not just another thrill like before
Every time your lips touch mine
We get closer all the time
And I can't trust me in your arms anymore
