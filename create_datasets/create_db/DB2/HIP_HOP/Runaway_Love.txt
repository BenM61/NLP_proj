Are you ready to roll?
Funky divas, with a cool isle stroll
Sending smooth vibes to all our great fans
It feels good to be grooving again.

Chocolate cream to me baby (so sweet to me)
Like some honey to a honey bee
I am drawn to you baby like a (strong magnet-oh!)
Once I'm there, there's no turning back
There is no real excuse, for take this abuse
I keep (running back, taking slack-don't know what to say or to do)
It's amazing, but I'm not crazy
I can't win it's a sin, so I feel I have to fight out

Like a train on open tracks now
It's too hard to turn it back now
Feels good without a doubt yeah
Has to stop before it turns me out.

Oh I'm not qualified (to put up with games with out)
I've been hurt hard lately 
(I'm not for being used) no more
Just a little lovin'
It's like a drug and I'm a drug addict
I just don't know why I just can't let go
I can't (walk away, fade away, everyday my love grows and grows)
It's cause of sickness
Or is it weakness should I cope?
Is there hope?
All I know is it's hard to go on.

Like a train on open tracks now
It's too hard to turn it back now
Feels good without a doubt yeah
Has to stop before it turns me out.

(High-h-h-h)Take me
Take me, take me(higher, higher)
(High-h-h-h)Oh, take me

Like a train on open tracks now
It's too hard to turn it back now
Feels good without a doubt yeah
Has to stop before it turns me out.

Oh, just a runaway love
Feel's good without a doubt baby
Has to stop before it turns me out.
