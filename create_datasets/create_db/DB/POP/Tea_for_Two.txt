He: I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own,
She: Darling this place is a lover's oasis where lights where we chase is unknown,
He: Far from the cry of the city where flowers pretty caress the stream,
Both: Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in, don't let it abide in my dream.

He: Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two, and two for tea.
Just me for you, and you for me alone.
She: Nobody near us, to see and to hear us, no friends or relations
On weekend vacations, we won't have it known, dear, that we own a telephone, dear.

He: They will brake (?) and you'll awake, and start to bake a sugar cake
For me to take for all the boys to see.
Both: We will raise a family, a boy for you and a girl for me,
Can't you see how happy we will be.
