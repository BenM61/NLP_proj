On the day 
I was born
Said my father
Said he
I'm an elegant legacy
Waiting for you
There's a rhyme for your
And a song for your heart
To sing it 
Whenever the world falls apart

Look
Look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over 
The hill and stream
Look
Look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream

It was sumptuous gift
To give to a child
Oh, the lure of that song
Kept me running wild
Never grow old
And stand still
With whipper wheels singing 
Beyond the next hill

Oh look
Look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over
The hill and stream
Look
Look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow 
Who follows a dream

So I bundled my heart
And I roamed the world free
To the east with a long 
To the west with a sea
And I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
But I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes

So look
Look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hill and stream
Look
Look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Follow the fellow
Who follows the dream
