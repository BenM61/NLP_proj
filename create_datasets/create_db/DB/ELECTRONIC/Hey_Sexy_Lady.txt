Hey Sexy Lady
I got a right to know, if this is mutual
Don't give me maybe

Yeah look

You looking hella fine
You could be my appetizer
I could be your app ya see
(Hey baby) You got me going crazy,
Fantasize 'bout you daily,
The approach alone took bravery

All it took was a shot to make her body roll,
She move it from the top then she drop it to the floor,
(Look)every magazine wanna shot wanna roll,
Told her give me what you got she told me here we go,
(Look)this be the part where you put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
My baby sweet darling baby girl,
You amaze me somebody save me
Say ahh, ahhh
Say ahh, ahhh

Damn she shining,
She move her body like it's rewinding,
Far from a dime(damn)she's a diamond
She grinding Stevie Wonder even saw her smiling,
Call me evil kinevil
Jumping over canyons just to see you
I do a little dance just to please you
You can be my queen I'll be the people, people, people

And if you see that lady keep your composure
Don't go crazy crazy crazy
