Why does Monday come before Tuesday
Why do summers start in June
Why do winters come too soon
Why do people fall in love
When they're always breaking up, oh why

Why do I love you, tell me why

It's not like I can explain what's in my heart
It's just I feel a crazy pain with we're apart
I don't want to breathe
I don't want to think
I don't want to love
I don't want to do anything

It's not like I can't describe what's going on
It's just I feel I'm not alive when your not home
I don't want to sleep
I don't want to be
I just want you here beside me
Without you there's no me

Why does Monday come before Tuesday
Why do summers start in June
Why do winters come too soon
Why do people fall in love
When they're always breaking up, oh why

Why do we love if love will die

Why does Wednesday come after Tuesday
Why do flowers come in May
Why does springtime go away
Why do people fall in love
When they're always breaking up
Oh why

Why do I love you, tell me why

It's not like I can escape what's in my soul
'Cause with you inside my heart where can I go
I don't want to see
No you without me
I can't go through life without you
Without you there's no me

Why does Monday come before Tuesday
Why do summers start in June
Why do winters come too soon
Why do people fall in love
When they're always breaking up, oh why

Why do we love if love will die?

Why do the rivers flow to the sea
Even if it flows
Why can't your love flow to me, babe
Why does my heart feel sadness
To be in love, to feel your love
Why don't I feel complete

Why does Monday come before Tuesday
Why do summers start in June
Why do winters come too soon
Why do people fall in love
When they're always breaking up, oh why

Why do I love you, tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell my why
Tell my why
