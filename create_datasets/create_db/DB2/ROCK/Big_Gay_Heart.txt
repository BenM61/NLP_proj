Take a look into some big grey eyes and ask yourself
You wanna make 'em cry?
Lookin' out of them it's just as well
But you're gonna live to see I'm gonna ask you why

Either way you got a bone to pick, can't you leave that to somebody else?
I don't need you to suck my dick or to help me feel good about myself

Big gay heart, please don't break my big gay heart
Big gay heart, please don't break my big gay heart

Why can't you look after yourself and not down on me?
Do you have to try to piss me off 'cause I'm easy to please?
Why can't you look after yourself and not down on me?
Yeah while I understand now you're not with the big gay scene

If you can find a way to add it up,
It might be hard but it might be enough
I'd be grateful, I'd be satisfied,
And you might find in time it wouldn't feel so bad
After all it doesn't take that much and it would mean the song to me
For you to lose the part that's still afraid and not prepared to see

My big gay heart
In the dark, my big gay heart
Big gay heart, please don't break my big gay heart

Why can't you look after yourself and not down on me?
Do you have to try to piss me off just 'cause I'm easy to please?
Why can't you look after yourself and not down on me?
Yeah while I understand now you're not with the big gay scene

Big gay heart, please don't break my big gay heart
Big gay heart, please don't break my big gay heart
My big gay heart
In the dark, big gay heart
My big gay heart, please don't break my big gay heart
