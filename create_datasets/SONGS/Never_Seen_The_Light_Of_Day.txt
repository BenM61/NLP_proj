She knows that if she ever breaks free
That she will never see the light of day
She's been blinded by the stars and dreams she craved
And if they ever let her go
She still be bound to all her fears
And all the medicine they forced her to take

On and on and on she goes
On and on and on she goes
But she will never ever ever find love
Unless she takes on a fight
Along with the northern light

They found her in the basement facing east
Howling wolves and inhaling beast
Were strangling every little dream she had in there
And if she ever finds her way
They will haunt her through the day 
Until she breaks and then becomes one of them, cause

On and on and on she goes
On and on and on she goes
But she will never ever ever find love
Unless she takes on a fight
Along with the northern light

Yeah

On and on and on she goes
On and on and on she goes
But she will never ever ever find love
Unless she takes on a fight
Along with the northern light

She knows
That if she ever let go
She will only loose her soul
There's no way out of this hell
Yeah
