As you might know my father is a rich man
His father was rich
I'm gonna be a rich man too, so yeah
Right now my job is to have fun but whatever I want
Just be with my girl
It's such fun, you know?

I guess you don't 'cause your daddy ain't driving a Rolls Royce
'N your family ain't famous after all
I flush my money down the toilet, if it is the best choice
Nothing is my problem see...

I don't have to pay my bills, right?
I don't have to get a job
I don't have to train my skills, right?
'Cause I will never be poor

Yeah
What would you do, if you had my money?
You wouldn't go to school, you wouldn't get a job, like me
You'd just hang around
You would go parties where all rich people meet
Where the people are having fun, yeah, such fun, you know

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't have to pay my bills, right? (pay my bills, right)
I don't have to get a job (have to get a job, right)
I don't have to train my skills, right? (have to train my skills, right ah...)
'Cause I will never be poor
