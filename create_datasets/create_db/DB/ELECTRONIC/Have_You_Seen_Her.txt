One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park
I have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day
They all gather 'round me, huh
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain
I know I can't hide from a memory
Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I've lied
Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her
Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her
Why, oh, why
Did she have to leave and go away?
Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...
I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost, baby, I'm lost
Oh, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her [Tell me have you seen her]
Oh, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her [Tell me have you seen her]
Oh, she left her kiss upon my lips
But left that break within my heart
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her
Oh, I see her hand reaching out to me
Only she can set me free
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her
Why, oh, why
Did she have to leave and go away
Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...
I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost, baby, I'm lost
Oh, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her [Tell me have you seen her]
As another day comes to an end
I'm lookin' for a letter or somethin'
Anything that she would send
With all the people I know, hmm
I'm still a lonely man
You know it's funny
I thought I had her in the palm of my hand
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her [Tell me have you seen her]
Oh (Oh, yeah...eah...eah...), doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Have you seen her (Have you seen her)
Tell me have you seen her (Have you seen her)
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her [Tell me have you seen her]
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her [Tell me have you seen her]
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her [Tell me have you seen her]
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her [Tell me have you seen her]
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her [Tell me have you seen her]
