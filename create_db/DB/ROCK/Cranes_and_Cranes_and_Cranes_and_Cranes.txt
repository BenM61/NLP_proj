Ba ba ba ba bada ba! 

We make our own mythologies
Your maps won't let us down again
Your legend's all played out
You're keeping some dark secrets
But you talk in your sleep

We make our own mythologies
All gangster scenes and bullet scars
Your fashion's three months late
If I had the guts I promise I would

Cut the powerlines
Tape the letterbox shut
I don't worry about those things
I don't worry about those
One grey mess to another grey mess
Distance knows a heavy heart best

Eve(ry) sin(gle), sin(gle) night (out)
For a lifetime of college films
(A sign! A sign! A sign! A sign!)
I'm hoping, I'm hoping, I'm hoping you don't call

Tear down our nightclubs, put up flats
Burn down our pubs and put up flats
All rows of neat new tracts
Why'd you want to live here if there's nothing but
Housing?

Your boyfriend owns the bar, we drink
Your boyfriend ruins everything
In a room with blinds drawn down
If I had the guts I promise I would 

Cut the powerlines
Tape the letterbox shut
I don't worry about those things
I don't worry about those 
From on grey mess to another grey mess
Distance knows a heavy heart best

Eve(ry) sin(gle), sin(gle) night (out)
For a lifetime of college films
(A sign! A sign! A sign! A sign! )
I'm hoping, I'm hoping, I'm hoping you don't call
