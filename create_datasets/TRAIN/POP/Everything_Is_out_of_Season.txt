Everything is out of season
The price of love is higher than the moo-oo-oon
Everything is out of season
Your kiss is like a wintery fall in June
And quite soon, you will be go-one

Everything is out of season
Your taste is like a frozen tangarine
Shivering without a reason
I think that's gonna be the promontory
Too much sunshine has come my way-ay-ay, baby
I can see you're lookin' fine
Lovin' kept on ice I can use anytime
To love was so much warmer on a colder day
Not so far away
And there's somethin' very strange that I just had to say-ay...

Everything is out of season
And dreams have got a way of growin' old
Everything is out of season
I think I've gone and caught a summer cold
And quite soon, you will be go-one, yeah, baby
Alright (ahh-ahh - ahh-ahh)

I can see you're lookin' fine
Lovin' kept on ice I can use anytime
To love you was so warmer on a colder day
Not so far away
And there's somethin' very strange that I just had to say-ay-ay

Wh-oh-woh-oh, everything is out of season, yeah
Dreams of got a way of growin' old, baby
Everything is out of season
And I think I've gone and caught a summer cold
And quite soon, you will be go-one, baby

Everything is out of season (ahh-ahh)
Everything is out of sea-eason (ahh-ahh)
Everything is out of sea-eason, baby (ahh-ahh) (fade)
