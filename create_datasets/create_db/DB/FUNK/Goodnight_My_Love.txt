Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And draw you closer to me

Before you go
There's just one thing I'd like to know
If your love is still warm for me
Or has it grown cold?

If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fear
For I'll be there, you know I care
Please give your love to me, dear, only

Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And draw you closer to me

If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fear
For I'll be there, you know I care
Please give your love to me, dear, only

Goodnight, goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight, my love 
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And draw you closer to me
Yeah, yeah!
I love you so, yeah, baby

Don't say goodnight
No, no, no, no baby, yeah
Don't say, don't say goodnight, baby
'Cause I love you
No, no, my baby, yeah baby
I gotta have your love
'Cause I love you, love you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

Please don't, please don't go

I don't want you to go, I don't want you to go, no
But I will go, no baby, yeah, yeah
