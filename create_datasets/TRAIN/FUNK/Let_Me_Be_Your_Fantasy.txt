Your love is overdue, the time is at hand
The hourglass is running out of sand
Wake up, you're still asleep
Are you dreaming too much?
Imaginary lovers can't be touched, look my way

Baby, let me be
Baby, let me be your fantasy
Baby, do you want
Baby, do you want my love?

Baby, let me be
Baby, let me be your fantasy
Baby, let me be
The vision you've been dreaming of

Let go of make believe, oh and touch someone real
A phantom love is something you can't feel
Your eyes say it all, you need it fast
Imaginary lovers just don't last, look my way
Look my way, look my way

Baby, let me be
Baby, let me be your fantasy
Baby, do you want
Baby, do you want my love?

Baby, let me be
Baby, let me be your fantasy
Baby, let me be
The vision you've been dreaming of

Dreaming of
Love
Dreaming of

Baby, let me be
Baby, let me be your fantasy
Baby, do you want
Baby, do you want my love?

Baby, let me be
Baby, let me be your fantasy
Baby, let me be
The vision you've been dreaming of
Baby, let me be
