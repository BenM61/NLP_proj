Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart upon a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it down for someone else
Cause loving him you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby can't you see
That he's not me
And

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open and will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

I'll follow any road
Anywhere to get to you
I'll open up my soul
If that's what you need me to do
Now baby its your move
All you've got to do
Is believe in love, just believe in us
Now...

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open and will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

Just believe in love, just believe in us
Baby

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open and will always be
Right here waiting, Staying strong
Come and fall into me

Come and fall into me
Baby fall into me
