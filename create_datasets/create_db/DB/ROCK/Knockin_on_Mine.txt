Alright
You read common knowledge, stockpile your brain
You get burned in the sun, you get wet in the rain
What they teach you to fix, needs to be broke
I say he who laughs first didn't get the joke
Go on, untap your mind
Quit knocking on mine

An English teacher from Vancouver
She asked me to write something for her students
I wrote knowledge adds, wisdom let slide
She says now really? I wanna tap your mind

Quit knockin' on mine
Walkin' on
Knockin' on mine

Knowledge is power, got your books go read 'em
Wisdom is ignorance; stupidity I call freedom
Knockin' on mine
Get out

Comic books, the Bible, road maps, pornography
Anything you wanna read
Go out and sit in a field sometime

Quit knockin' on mine (knockin' on mine)
Quit knockin' on mine (knockin' on mine)

...Power got your books go read 'em
Wisdom is ignorance, stupidity, I call freedom
Quit knockin' on mine (knockin' on mine)

You read common knowledge every day.
You're as common as that newspaper you throw away
You get burned in the sun, you get wet in the rain
Won't you ever change
Won't you ever learn

Quit knockin' on mine (knockin' on mine)
Yes sir
Quit knockin' on mine (knockin' on mine)
Quit knockin' on mine (knockin' on mine)
