Hold hold up hold up
Slow slow down
Listen give me 10 minutes
Well gimme 5 minutes aight
B-before you leave I just need these last 4 minutes

Pardon me if I'm talking fast and stumbling all over my words
I heard you were leavin' town I thought I'd be the one to know first
If you have a minute let me talk to you and see what's going on
Don't say it's nothing when it's something that's gone wrong
Now let me explain but I don't know what to say
Cause I don't know what the hell happened
I come in the house to try to work it out
And all you're doing is packing
Close your suitcase let me think straight
Damn what could be the reason?
Baby talk me I'm almost outta time

I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do to prove to you that I'm gonna do anything
Only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay and show you that I done change
Cause in 4 minutes I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes I'm a lose her to some other man
For no less no more
I'm desperate cause the clocks ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go

Who are these people I don't know in my house and they scratching my floors
Takin' furniture outside and the U-Haul pull up to my door
What's the reason that I get this feelin that you can't keep it real with me
Is it cause of the prime relationships I had off in the streets?
Never mind that this is your conscience speaking and you need to get your girl back
You gotta find a way to try to get to her heart
I'm takin' suggestions I've learned my lesson
Think conscience you're my last lifeline
I'm down to my last second

I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do to prove to you that I'm gonna do anything
I only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay and show you that I done change
(I'm a changed man)
Cause in 4 minutes I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes I'm a lose her to some other man (I'll be all alone)
For no less no more
I'm desperate cause the clocks ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go

(I've done) I've done things in my past
I thought this love would last
But I can't let you go baby
You're my everything lady
The reason I smile and the reason I talk baby
The reason I breathe, the only one for me, yea
You can't go through with this
If you left me my life wouldn't exist
Cause I'm still in love with you
And that's my word I don't give a damn what you heard
Oh, baby I'll be true

I only got 4 minutes
And I'm running out of time
I only got 4 minutes
I only got 4 minutes

4 minutes I'll never have my girl again (I'll never have)
In 4 minutes (oh no) I'm a lose her to some other man (I'm a lose her)
For (oh ho) no less no more
(And I just can't take it I don't want it happen I won't let it happen)
Cause the clocks ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go (oh no)

Only got 4 minutes to tell you everything I love about you
4 minutes to say I need you, I can't live without you
I'm out of time gotta say what's on my mind
Just to keep you in my life
Aw, damn I'm outta time
