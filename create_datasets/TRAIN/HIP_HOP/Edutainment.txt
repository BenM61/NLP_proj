(KRS One) 
Give it to em! 

Nuff respect! And praise to the creator 
Over the years it seems that I became a 
landmark  in the hip hop field of art 
I shed light  yet my skin is dark 
I'm not conerned with climbin the chart 
Cause why should you pay when it comes from the heart? 
I'll start  cause only Jah will create it 
I'll just name it  Edutainment 
People sit and they look at my album 
like a problem, they try to solve em 
They don't know, it only leads the way 
to a bright more positive day 
By itself, it's NOT the bright day 
Sit up straight, and hear what I say 
Fear and ignorance, I'm down for stoppin this 
but the bright day is your consciousness 
I am poet, my words will heal you 
I'm not a phony I'll really feel you 
That's why I walk and talk to my nation 
Wherever they are, in any situation 
They usually ask for an autograph 
And I'll whip out the pen and just write Blast- 
-Master, K-are-S, O-N-E 
BDP, Peace and Unity 
But do not concentrate on the paper 
Concentrate on the laws of the creator 
Cause when the paper's gone, it will deceive you 
But Allah will never leave you 

Nothing I say now is hypothetical 
These are the facts, a little metaphysical 
We are one, every heart every lung 
So why then was the black man hung? 
He was hung by the so-called Christians 
that went to church, and did not listen 
See Jesus couldn't stand politics 
so they nailed him to a crucifix 
Then it was that way, today it's a trigger 
So why is the Pope such a political figure? 
I don't know, but it's really beyond me 
But through knowledge, they'll NEVER con me 
Cause from Jesus Christ to right now 
everytime a black man speaks up, KA-POW 
See people concentrate on the leader 
And not the message comin through the speaker 
If the Christians really heard Christ 
the black man never would've lived this life 
My point is that do not concentrate 
on what I state, create, or debate 
I might be great, and you might admire 
But what I say is to take you MUCH higher 
MORE higher than the physical plane 
to the plane of forces in the astral plane 
The mental plane, and the final three 
They're all around you, yet you can't see 
So grab the sphere of life and aim it 
and you'll be guided by Edutainment
