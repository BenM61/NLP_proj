What is this new exaltation that I just can't explain?
What are these new inspirations that I can't get out of my brain?
How am I gonna sleep with this feelin' rushin all through my veins?
Get up, come on, lets do something, don't you wanna go get saved?

The night is calling you to act
Act upon every urge
You can't get no satisfaction if you ain't got the courage
I don't know what you're afraid of, I don't know what you heard.
Get up, come on lets do something, don't you wanna know the word

Who's gonna save us when them spiders get next to you
Spinning their sticky webs around what you do
We gotta safeguard against the forked tongue and the treachery of the wicked one
Get up, come on, lets do something

Don't matter how far you have to
The truth has got to be	told,
No matter how shiny you're lips 
There'll never be streets of gold
They might try to get us crazy
Cause they don't know what I've heard
But we got this new exaltation 
I'm talking about the word

Who's gonna save us when them spiders get next to you (next to you)
Spinning their sticky webs around what you do (what you do)
We gotta safeguard against the forked tongue and the treachery of the wicked one (wicked one)
Get up, come on, lets do something!

Get up, come on lets do something, no reason to feel this pain
Get up, come on lets do something, come on girl, let's get saved
Get up, come on lets do something, no reason to feel this pain
Get up, come on lets do something, come on girl, let's get saved

Get up, come on lets do something! [Repeat: x4]

There's no reason to feel uneasy
There's no reason to feel such pain,
Get, up come on, let's do something
Don't you wanna go get saved
