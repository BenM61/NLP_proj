It's goin' down tonight, you know I gots to go get fitted 
Hit the mall to get it, then I stop to get my hair 
Twisted up in pony tails 
Then sell a bill, back to the grain 

And let my peoples know, you know it's goin' down tonight 
Merry livin' 
I got the 4-1-1 on the bumpin' 
We ridin' we them heat, as if they funk 

And them we dumpin' 
I'm slumpin' in the meantime 
My speakers is jumpin' up out they box 
I see these broads choosin', man they sprung on my Shirly locks 

Ugh, made the block 
And they was all up on my bumper 
Tryin' to pull me over 
But now I gets a nothin' when I'm sober 

Hit the gas and smoked it up, smashed off, I'm outtie 
Bendin' corners, laughin' 'cause I left they car cloudy 
Went to my partna house and they was postin', splittin', Vegas 
Bet 5 dollas a game on Mat and 95 on Sega 

Taggin' out the room, fools layin' on the ground 
They better have some get back 'cause tonight it's goin' down 

 
[Chorus: x 2]
It's goin' down tonight 
Tonight it goes down 
It's goin' down tonight 
Tonight it goes down 
 
[Celly] 
Closed up shop on the Sega, now we slammin' bones 
Up in my hood, it's on, we make a casino up out yo' home 
Head up, I sets 'em down fast for the stash 
Yellin' "stand up!" when you pass 

Turn over your bones and give me your cash 
I hit the store with the money I won to get me a 4-0 
A double O on the scene, I'm a O-G on the ink fo' sho' 
I get twisted up in knots, ?per? straight sloppy 

Prize breaders on my nuts and haters want to knock me 
Can't understand how deep I get 
When I split this real on real da real 
Straight up out they heels due 

In a minute we'll still talk 
Boots stompin', outta my head 
To the womp, and get my knees dirty 
When I'm stinkin', I'm on da dots for Thompson 

Side bettin', Little Joe in the doe 
Now watch me roll 
I let 'em go and watch that double duece lock up fo' sho' 
I talk static, clown 

Walkin' around & makin' my rounds 
Snatchin' my money up off the ground 
'Cause tonight it's goin' down 

[Chorus; x 2]

[Celly] 
Shot to the house to get dressed, it's finally night fall 
Jumped in my 7-4, smashed it, 'cause I'm tight why'all 
Checkin' to see if the tape was on the passenger seat 
I need some heat 

The only way I'm gon' creep 
Late night through these faulty streets 
Hit the block & seen the whole crew on the corner 
Smellin' that aroma, talkin' about the bump and comin' up on her 

Super fast, sumpin' cool 
You know how we do it 
Touch 'em wit some game 
And fill 'em wit some dick fluid 

We hit then store, it's about 30 playas bailin' in 
Give me some see & be	, some Hennessy, & Sequels Gin 
Let me squeeze but no chasin', fool we straight lacin' 
Jumpin' and mobbin', punchin' 'til the both of us playas racin' 

We pulls up and see 'em posted outside 
Gettin' gone 
I'm in the zone, ready to take me somethin' home 
Wall to wall breaders, top notch, it's mean, it's goin' down 

At this bump I found 
Tonight fool, it's goin' down 

[Chorus until fade]
