Crazy way to get you're kicks
They shoot the silicone in you're lips
If you're figure makes you sad
They suck the fat right of you're back

Make up you're mind about you're tits girls
They can puff em up so no bra will fit girls 
There's only one thing they can't fix
No I won't let you be mislead
And that's the hole in you're head
Can't do nothing about that

Hell hell modern world
Hell hell to all you boys and girls
Hell hell hell the colour green
Hell hell to what I've seen
Hell hell hell this modern world

You tell her that's she's beautiful
You put her on a
But as you're
Imagination kicks in

The more you think about sex boys
With someone else the better it gets boys
You have a purpose in you're life 
Besides cheating on the wife
For f*ck sake show some sense

Hell hell modern world
Hell hell to all you boys and girls
Hell hell hell the colour green
Hell hell to what I've seen
Hell hell hell this modern world

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

These days adoption is a hot thing 
You can get a child for nearly nothing
You take them home to a nanny
Buy off you're guilt with toys and candy
But all the money that you work for girls 
Can't compare it to love boys 

there's only one thing they can't fix 
No I won't let you be mislead
And that's the hole in you're head
Can't do nothing about that
Hell hell modern world
Hell hell to all you boys and girls
Hell hell hell the colour green
Hell hell to what I've seen
Hell hell hell this modern world

Ahh 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
