When I lost my way, found myself on rugged road 
With a head full of trouble carryin' a heavy, heavy load 
I was stumblin' blind, goin down that rugged road 
and no one could help me I had to walk that road alone 
When I met my friend, he said brother can I help you please 
I know you got worries maybe some that I can ease 
It's a long long way and you might need some company 
but I just couldn't hear him and he just let me be 
My father before me, walked that road the same as I 
He had his bad and his good times, and one day he had to die 
People I made my way, and now I'm standin' in the sun 
With my struggle behind me, my life has just begun
