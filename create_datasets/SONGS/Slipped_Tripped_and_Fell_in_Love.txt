I knew from the very beginning
What you had in mind
But I said to myself, baby
You're gonna just waste your time

But somehow during the night, baby
Things started to get out of hand
And I found myself (found myself)
Falling in love again (falling in love again)

I slipped (tripped) fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby
Yes, I did, I slipped, tripped
Fell in love, fell in love
With you, baby, oh, yeah

Getting stuck on you, baby
Was the last thing I had in mind
But now you got me wanting you, baby
Want your love all the time

When you touch me, baby
(Oh, baby) I just lose control
And I find myself (find myself)
Wanting more of you down in my soul

I slipped (tripped) fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby

Lord, it's all right, yeah 

I slipped (tripped) fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby
And I like it like that
I slipped (tripped) fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby

I slipped (tripped) fell in love
Fell in love with you, baby
