What I've seen, you might find it hard to believe
It left feeling like, no one had ever made me
I want something, unsurpassed in its pleasures
Because even the truest love, still can't last forever

I want something I've never seen through these eyes
I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
I want something I've never seen through these eyes
I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
In this body of mine

When you hurt me, is it because you hurt yourself
When you look at me, why not try to see yourself
I want something that won't force my ears to listen
Because even the truest love, is still gonna have something missing

I want something I've never seen through these eyes
I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
I want something I've never seen through these eyes
I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
In this body of mine

I'm uncomfortable, in regular clothes
I want something I can depend on
And watch it grow
And watch it grow

Enlighten to me, I never want to be here again
Set me free, I never want to feel fear again
Please Pardon me, as I never meant to hurt anyone
Let me be, stronger for everyone

I want something I've never seen through these eyes
I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
In this body of mine

I want something that doesn't come easy
I want it so bad, I know some day I'll be that
I want it, but I know I'll never feel it not in this body of mine
In this body of mine
