She was a woman troubled like a river
Trees all around her
But I only ever came near enough
To hear her voice
On the outside

She was a woman inside a castle
Knights all around her
And I never found myself strong enough
To reach and touch
From the outside

And every time I tried to swim across
I thought I'd drown
And every time I tried to climb that wall
I thought I'd fall
On the outside

She was a woman frozen in a picture
Frozen there forever
With a smile that keeps me so warm inside
But still I hide
On the outside

She was a woman farther than forever
Nearer not together
And I only wish I was back in time
'Cause she'd be mine
On the outside

But every time I tried to find the love 
I left behind
But every time I tried to make her mine
Again I'd find myself
On the outside
