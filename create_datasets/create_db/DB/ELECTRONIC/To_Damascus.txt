From the long forgotten garden
On a ship tie to the mast
I'm sailin' over to Damascus
Driven forward by the past

And in the long forgotten chaos
Sits the one I'm looking for
Sailing over to Damascus
Landing on this desert shore

Arriving in the golden city
I start to sing my chant d'amour
Without loyalty and pity
For the one I'm looking for

From the long forgotten garden
On a ship tie to the mast
I'm sailin' over to Damascus
Driven forward by the past

Arriving in the golden city
I start to sing my chant d'amour
Neither loyalty nor pity
For the one I'm looking for
