Grimly fiendish plays the game that never plays
Sing out loud but never prayed
Grimly fiendish wears a coat that's black and long
He doesn't know that it's all wrong

Simply fiendish, a child caught in a grown up world
No lies convince the court
Once a week I could be found on the faces all the frowns
Hide and seek, tried so hard to find that crime could pay
Just for today

Let me get the story straight
You never gave me a break
It's a case of give and take
You didn't make me good you just painted me green
You made me part of your forgotten dream

Grimly fiendish, we'll send you just where you belong
Where the children can't be found
