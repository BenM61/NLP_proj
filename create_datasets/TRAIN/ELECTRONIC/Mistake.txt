Don't speak to me this way 
Don't ever let me say 
Don't leave me again
Don't leave me again
I never felt this loss before 
And the world is closing doors 
I never wanted anything more 

Don't speak to me this way 
Don't ever let me say 
Don't leave me again
I never felt this loss before 
And the world is closing doors 
I never wanted anything more 

Don't hug me this way 
Don't touch me this way 
Don't hug me again
Don't hug me again
Don't hug me this way 
Don't touch me this way 
Don't hug me this again

Don't hug me this way 
Don't touch me this way 
Don't hug me again
Don't hug me this way 
Don't touch me this way 
Don't hug me this again

I never felt this loss before 
And the world is closing doors 
I never wanted anything more 
Don't let me make the same mistake again 
Please, don't let me make the same mistake again 
Don't let me make the same mistake again 
I never felt this loss before 
And the world is closing doors 
I never wanted anything more 
Please, don't let me make the same mistake again
Please, don't let me make the same mistake again
