You go
When the weight of the water
Has finally carried you home

We know 
How the current can feel 
Like the breathing of watery ghosts

Followed my friends
To the splashing side
We were drowing and laughing
Along with the tide
It sucked me down
But I let it slide back up 
To the child inside

How's my baby,
He asked of me
As we were pushing our way
Out to the sea
But I said nothing more
And not more said he
And the ghost drove on so forcefully

You go
When the weight of the water
Has finally carried you home

We know
How the current can feel
Like the breathing of watery ghosts

How do I (something) the rocks
I'm lost inside

Now I push along behind
The beast with the liquid hide

How long do I (something) the rocks
I'm lost inside

Now I push along behind
The beast with the liquid hide
