[Chorus]
Today is a lucky day
We can get away 
Just tell the DJ to play (and play)
I just want to hear you play my favorite song
I just to hear you play my favorite

[Verse 1]
DJ's got me feeling kinda sexy 
Got my body moving on the floor 
Everytime i hear that Funky music
I just let the rhythm take control 
Come on...come on

[Chorus 1]
I like the jam your playing for me (don't stop don't stop that jam)
Don't stop the jam just play it for me
(it's that jam yeah, it's that jam yeah)

[chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
When you put the needle on the record 
Ain't nobody standing on the wall 
Everybody's stepping at this party
Doing what we're doing 
Everybody just get down and have a ball 

[chorus 1]

[chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Let the music play till the break of day yeah
Got to feel the groove got to make a move
As we dance all night till the morning light 

It's that jam [x4]

[Chorus 2]

Come on get up and dance [x8]
