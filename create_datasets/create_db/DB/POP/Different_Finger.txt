Please put your rings on a diff'rent finger if you meet me tonight
'cause I can't stand those suspicious glances
'cause I know the things they're saying are right

They're saying why don't you straighten up
And see what you've got to lose
Put it all down to fate but you still got the chance to choose

I don't want to hear your whole life story
Or about my strange resemblance to some old flame
All I want is one night of glory
I don't even know your second name

Please put your rings on a diff'rent finger 'cause we've got so much at stake
I can't stand those suspicious glances
'cause they seem to cover ev'ry move I make

But if I can be alone with you completely tonight
Put your rings on a diff'rent finger
Before I turn out the light
