I say faces are changing, faces are gathering 
 the good times brought people to my door 
 I need an outstretched, open hand, with a little understanding 
 to pick me up and dust me from this floor 
 people from the good times that was easy 
 but people from the bad times I thank you 'cause 
 
 Changes make faces come and go 
 got a look in your eyes it's the only way I know 
 changes make faces come and go 
 eyes on you face are the windows to your soul 
 
(to your soul) 
 On body there's a footprint 
 in my mind an imprint 
 in your eyes just a little glint of guilt 
 I've taken the ride I've paid the fare 
 now stop me if you, stop me if you dare 
 people from the good times that was easy 
 but people from the bad times I thank you (cos) 
 
 Changes make faces come and go 
 got a look in your eyes it's the only way I know 
 changes make faces come and go 
 eyes on you face are the windows to your soul 
 
(to your soul) 
 On body there's a footprint 
 in my mind an imprint 
 in your eyes just a little glint of guilt 
 I've taken the ride I've paid the fare 
 now stop me if you, stop me if you dare 
 people from the good times that was easy 
 but people from the bad times I thank you (cos) 
 
 changes make faces come and go 
 got a look in your eyes it's the only way I know 
 changes make faces come and go 
 eyes on your face are the windows to your soul 
 
(to your soul) 
 But people from the bad times I thank you
