Once I was a king
I thought always a king
'Cause I just captured someone's heart
But may I explain, I treated her mean
 
And then my kingdom fell apart

[Chorus:]
I found I couldn't sleep at night
And when I found her gone from sight
Found out I loved her
Became a joker
The joker went wild and he couldn't smile
'Cause he had lost everything
The joker went wild and he couldn't smile
He felt no longer like a king

Some friendly advice
Treat her heart nice or she won't
Stay for very long if at all
If you think you're a king
And you know everything
Just remember, the joker or you'll fall from her arms

You'll find you cannot sleep at night
And when you find she's gone from sight
You'll find you loved her
Became a joker

[Chorus]
