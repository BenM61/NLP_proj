Where you gonna go in your winter coat?
I wonder what you're hiding cause it's not too cold
It's already too late
Somebody's gonna get you

And if I hold you too tight
Someone else won't get to
Oh, wouldn't you know it?
I keep it rolling
Considering no one
Punching a path
Facing the blast and the moon and the math
But you still never know where your soul is attached

Oh, wouldn't you know it?
Ah, wouldn't you know it?

I'm so confused
I can't move
I can't even try

I hope you find someone to lose
Someday

Now where you gonna go like a cobra coiled
Sweating in a sweater, you got too much style
But you're never alone
Some day they're gonna get you

I hope you find someone to lose
Someday
I hope you find
I hope you find someone to lose
Someday

Ah, wait
Come back
