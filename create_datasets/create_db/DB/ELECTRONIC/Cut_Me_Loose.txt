So this is what it is
I'm just another kiss
After you swore to me
Now I can truly see

I should of known when you came to me
I had eyes on a treasure I couldn't keep
Got so buried in love I could hardly breathe
Fed you all of my heart and you swallowed me
Now I'm starving
Stop wasting my time babe
No more changing your mind of me
Cut me loose
Do it for my sake
I'll be better on my own

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm breaking the silence
It's time that I do what's best for me
Cut me loose
And try to forget me
I'll be better own my own, on my own
I'll be better own my own, on my own

How did it all begin
Maybe I'm caving in
Nothing I know is clear
Where do I go from here

I should of known when you came to me
I had eyes on a treasure I couldn't keep
Got so buried in love I cold hardly breathe
Fed you all of my heart and swallowed me
Now I'm starving
Stop wasting your my babe
No more changing your mind of me
Cut me loose
Do it for my sake
I'll be better on my own

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm breaking the silence
It's time that I do what's best for me
Cut me loose
And try to forget me
I'll be better own my own, on my own

Lying low and giving my best not to fret
As I go on
'Cause I don't want even a breath of your sadness
To hope on, take nothing more,
I got no more to waste
Moving forward, there's too much to face
But I know that it's my only way

Stop wasting my time babe
No more changing your mind of me
Cut me loose
Do it for my sake
I'll be better on my own

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm breaking the silence
It's time that I do what's best for me
Cut me loose
And try to forget me
I'll be better own my own, on my own
I'll be better own my own, on my own
I'll be better own my own, on my own
