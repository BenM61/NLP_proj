Streets that have no name
All the lights are turned down low
And the night is here for us
Calling of the wild
From the space inside ourselves
We are ready, the chosen ones

Thousand miles away
Light is on its way
Leave this day behind
One last night on earth
One last night on earth
Breaking down the wall
Everything will fall
Leave yourself behind
One last night on earth
One last night on earth

Echoes from the past
All the friends we loved and lost
At the feel, were it all began
Children of the beat
Let the 303 be free
We are ready, the beautiful ones

Thousand miles away
Light is on its way
Leave this day behind
One last night on earth
One last night on earth
Breaking down the wall
Everything will fall
Leave yourself behind
One last night on earth
One last night on earth
