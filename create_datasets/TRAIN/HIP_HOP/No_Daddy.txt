I didn't have no daddy around when I was growing up (huh)
That's why I'm wild and I don't give a (huh)
Ya'll think 'cause these jeans fit, I would give it up
Don't let my cute face fool ya
I didn't have no daddy around when I was growing up (huh)

Been through so much in my life
Seen things in my life
That I never thought I'd make it through
Had a few close calls in my life
That could have ended my life
But I'm here looking at you
Never thought that I'd be here
I'm the type that don't give a damn about rules
I was forced to survive on the streets
Make my own way to eat
Gotta do what I gotta do (Best believe)

I know plenty of girls like me
That done been through hell just like me
Keep what your mama teach ya
Don't let cheat or the street defeat ya (Girlfriend)
And all my kickass girls like me
That ain't ever afraid to speak
Next time that they try to treat ya
Like you a freak just so he can look good
Tell them

I didn't have no daddy around when I was growing up (huh)

No I don't strip in the club
Nor trick in the club
But I got friends that do
So my girls that's getting the dough
The best way they know
Don't hate girl I got you
Even though it ain't me (I understand)
That its real in these streets (I understand)
When it comes to that rent, that whip
That check, ain't nobody gonna protect your neck like you

I know plenty of girls like me
That done been through hell just like me
Keep what your mama teach ya
Don't let cheat or the street defeat ya (Girlfriend)
And all my kickass girls like me
That ain't ever afraid to speak
Next time that they try to treat ya
Like you a freak just so he can look good

When you're feeling all alone
And you feel you can't go on (call me)
