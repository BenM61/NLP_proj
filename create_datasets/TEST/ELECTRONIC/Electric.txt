Darker than the ocean, deeper than the sea
You got everything, you got what I need
Touch me, you're electric, babe
Move me, take me from this place
Movin' to the tempo, show me what it takes
Speedin' up my heartbeat, playin' in the face

Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space
Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space

Covered in your water and I'm feelin' like a summer breeze
Submitted under power and you brought me to my knees
Use me, you're electric, babe
Move me, take me all the way
Whisper in my ear, I'm the only one you're lovin' on
Take advantage of the moment, you're the only one that I want

Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space
Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space

Melting like ice on a summer day
Hold me like you mean it, take me far away
Bodies movin' and temperature rising
Take me to the top then watch me fall in

Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space
Kiss me, we're on fire
