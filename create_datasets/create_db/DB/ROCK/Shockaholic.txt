The smell of soap and cigarettes
A litterbin of social debts
I never learnt I never learn
You've got to laugh I just get burned

Head in a vice - do it up tight
Bullets you bite - never tasted so nice
This is your life - would you like another slice?

Shockaholic
So bored of it
You can't stop it
Shockaholic

I curl myself into a ball
And then you kick me down the hall
I never learnt I never learn...

Head in a vice...
Shockaholic...
Shockaholic
Shockaholic
Chronic
Shocka holic.
