The cost of lovings on the line again
Honey, that just won't do
As we turn another blind eye
Oh, they steal it from you
But the feelings coming back
Guess it always will
No matter how hurt you've been

Cost of lovings on the line
Honey that just won't do
Might take a little bit of time
Oh, but I've faith in me and you

The black market on the side
Oh, we take more than we need
And take it in our stride
Starving those who we feed

When the feeling starts again
Then we'll do more right than wrong
Waiting for a brighter day
Has always been too long

The cost of lovings on the line
Honey that just won't do
