Thanks for the times that you've given me,
The memories are all in mind.
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud!

Your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you.
Yes, your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!

When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart.
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you.
There's nothing to keep us apart
You're once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!
I love you !
