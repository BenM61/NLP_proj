I kiss my window facing south
Where endless rains are splashing blue
My mouth spills an ocean of words
Crashing waves of intention

If I stood still
Under dark gray skies
Would memories flood me
With alibis

It's here where I stand
With time in hand
Prophesize those days
Rain on me

Wash the rain away my dear

Incandescence can dance 
Through white shades of sand
Perfects skies
Tell the tides
Rain on me

A thousand days of rain

And I see the sunrise kissing my face
Sometimes
And I know the sun shines down on me

Rain on me

Feel the sunlight in my face
See the sunshine in my grace
Now that I know I am here
Wash the rain away my dear
