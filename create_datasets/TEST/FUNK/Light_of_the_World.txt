Verse 1
I say a prayer for all the people
It's a prayer for everyone
For the hungry and the homeless
For all the children in the streets 

Verse 2
For the looser and the winner
For the happy and the sad
For the young and the old
For the rich and the poor

Light of the world won't you come and light our path
Light of the world won't you help us get on track

Verse 3
And a prayer for all the lonely
For the ones who lost all hope
For the ones who've given up
And for all I've failed to mention

Bridge
Won't you let your comfort fall on us
Won't you let your spirit fall on us 
Won't you come and heal us all
