Ooh, doo, doo doo, doo

Simply beautiful, your plan is to wipe out
The hope that we all hold out
Nobody gets left out and it pays to belong
Cool and hard, baby, that's what you are
And your brief is to kill off resistance
Pity the victims, and it pays to belong

There's no sense of shame
Only money gained
When it all goes wrong
And it pays to belong
Yes, it pays to belong
Another bullish day
But who's gonna pay
When it all comes down
Said it pays to belong
Yes, it pays to belong

You're a part of everybody's world here
No romance, no ties at all
Everybody's buying shares in your lies
'Cause they don't realize
I was dreaming about your troubled ways
I cast an eye over your estate
Twenty-one stabbed, Twenty-one raped
I hear they're putting up your rates

There's no sense of shame
Only money gained
When it all goes wrong
And it pays to belong
Yes, it pays to belong
Another bullish day
But who's gonna pay
When it all comes down
Said it pays to belong
Yes, it pays to belong, yeah

There's no sense of shame
Only money gained
When it all goes wrong
And it pays to belong
Yes, it pays to belong
Another bullish day
But who's gonna pay
When it all comes down, down, down
It pays to belong
Yes, it pays to belong

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
And it pays to belong
Yes, it pays to belong, to belong
Get it on

It pays to belong
