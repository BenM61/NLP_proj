When I grow old, I'll drink and smoke
Like I did when youth stayed, youth stayed
'Til the second round
When I grow old, the sun will cope
Shining on every youth stain, youth stain
Never settling down

And no wonder
I keep you close
You're the water
To quench my throat
And if I never
Let you go
Will you keep me young
Keep
Me young

When I grow old, my weathered soul
And memories recluse, elusive
Help me take them out
So keep me young and call my bluffs
And help me out when you say, you say
There's no rules foretold

Say I'm stronger
And keep me close
And be the water
And test my cold
And if I never
Let you go
Will you keep me young
Keep
Me young

Oh, when my heart stops beating
And my blood turns cold, and oh
When my heart stops beating
And my breath won't flow, and oh
When my heart stops beating
When you go, oh no, I know

Oh, when my heart stops beating
And my blood turns cold, and oh
When my heart stops beating
And my breath won't flow, and oh
When my heart stops beating
When you go, oh no, I

When I grow old, I'll drink and smoke
But just as long as you stay, you stay
I found a way out
