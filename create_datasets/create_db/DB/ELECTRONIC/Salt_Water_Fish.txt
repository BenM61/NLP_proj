All I can see is what I've fried
And all the world in your black eye.

I'll run in circles all the time
I'll gather up all that is mine,
Into the room inside my head,
The walls are black, the roof is red.

And fiery like a volcano
I wear it like a massive halo
This pretty speckled length of twine
That's wrapped around your neck is mine.
A ruby rose, stiffed and froze is what I give to you

I'll run in circles all the time
I'll gather up all that is mine,
Into the room inside my head,
The walls are black, the roof is red.

If I could taste your salty head,
And pick the dead hair from your eyes,
Let your smell the sweet despise,
Those peaks and troughs, guts for a valley,
Are a dead Sean in my back alley,
How tall and wide you have to get,
How big and dark and badly lit,
And if I said I did, would you believe me,
And I showed you gold, would you see through me
And if tomorrow didn't come,
Would you?

I'll run in circles all the time
I'll gather up all that is mine,
Into the room inside my head,
The walls are black, the roof is red.

I'll run in circles all the time
I'll gather up all that is mine,
Into the room inside my head,
The walls are black, the roof is red.

I'll run in circles all the time
I'll gather up all that is mine,
Into the room inside my head
