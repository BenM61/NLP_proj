We used to be so certain
we used to know the game
but now we run in circles
get lost along the way

Nights forever falling
entangled in the haze
but in the light of dawn
we watch it burn away

So long as I can breathe
it's you who shakes me
So long as I can breathe
you're still the one who wakes me

So if we're tired of trying
and we'll forget the days
when nothing came before us
and no one else could change

Because where there's smoke there's fire
and hidden in the gray
there's still a spark in us
hold on to yesterday
So long as I can breathe
