I find myself a child again
Asleep in Baby Lotion
The air was thick
With Scalextric
And the cars were in slow motion
Going up like an air bubble caught in a vein
Going down like a thermos flask thrown from a train
You go ahead, and I'll follow my phobia down
I cried myself to sleep because
They wouldn't leave the light on
I clawed the rails
With broken nails
Now there's nothing left to bite on
Going up like an air bubble caught in a vein
Going down like a thermos flask thrown from a train
You go ahead, and I'll follow my phobia down
Going up like the corners of Dali's moustache
Going down like the United in the Munich air crash
You go ahead and I'll follow my phobia down
Splendour in the grass
Freeze Frame
A splintering of glass
Steam train
Stop you're going too fast
Please Freeze Frame
Frame, Freeze Frame, Freeze Frame
Please Freeze
I asked my mum about the stains in the kitchen
She said, "Bang you're dead" and truth is stranger than fiction
Truth is stranger than fiction
I find myself designing rooms that
Never let the light in
With no way in and
No way out
And a space to fly my kite in
Going up like an air bubble caught in a vein
Going down like a thermos flask thrown from a train
You go ahead, and I'll follow my phobia down
Going up like a body rejecting a heart
Going down like Neanderthal Man in the chart
You go ahead and I'll follow my phobia down
