City night
White on white
In your eyes
Steals your gaze
Anything
Before it steals away

Paper dolls
On the wires
Set on fire
Take each coal
Between us
Takes us all away

Sorry, sometimes
I get carried away

Up on the movie screen
Black beauty limousines for you
These dreams of chasing days
Fake flowers to the grave for you
Helpless and glimmering
Dear some days, up all night with you

Sorry, sometimes
I get carried away
Sorry, sometimes
I get carried away
Sorry (Helpless and glimmering)
Sometimes (Fake flowers to the grave for you)
I get carried away 
Sorry (Up on the movie screen)
Sometimes (Fake flowers to the grave for you)
I get carried away 
Sorry (Helpless and glimmering)
Sometimes (Fake flowers to the grave for you)
I get carried away
