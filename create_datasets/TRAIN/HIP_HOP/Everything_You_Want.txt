A'ight, who is that
Better calm down around here 
Hey girl, whatever you want, I got 
Hey yeah 

Everything
Everything that you want from me (Say what) 
I'm gonna give it all to you 

Baby, if you please, tell me your desires 
Of your heart (of your heart) 
One thing I can see 
You're in need of lovin' 
I can give it to you (hey, hey) 
Don't lower your expectations 
So you can say that you're just
Someone in love 
Baby, 'cause in my estimation 
You should get all that you want 
And it's my pleasure just to give it to you 

Everything that you want from me (from me now, baby)

Everything you want me to be (me to be) 
I'm gonna be there just for you 

Girl, it's a possibility 
That you've been lonely for too long (too long) 
Well, I've got remedy for your frustration 
In the words of this song 
This song, baby 
Come closer my love, I've got more than you need
To keep you satisfied 
If it's me that you need 
You can get it from me 
You don't have to worry 
'Cause I'm gonna give it to you 

Everything that you want from me (I'm gonna give it to you, baby)
