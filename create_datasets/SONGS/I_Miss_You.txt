Though you've been gone for just a week
It waken me feel so sad to speak
Baby, come back
I miss you

And though before I didn't cry
Now my eyes are never dry
And a thousand jesters
Couldn't make me smile
I miss you, I miss you 

And now I know that I was wrong
But it's too late for now you've gone
Baby, come back
I miss you 

And though our times were good and bad
Now you're gone I'm always sad
And a thousand jesters
Couldn't make me smile
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you.
