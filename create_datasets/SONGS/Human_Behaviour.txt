If you ever get close to a human
And human behavior
Be ready, be ready to get confused

There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
To human behavior
But yet so, yet so irresistible

And there's no map

They're terribly moody
And human behavior
Then all of a sudden turn happy

But, oh, to get involved in the exchange
Of human emotions
Is ever so, ever so satisfying

Oh oh, and there's no map

Human behavior, human
Human, human behavior, human
Human, human behavior, human
Human behavior, human

And there's no map
And the compass
Wouldn't help at all

Human behavior, human, human
Human behavior, human
Human behavior, human
Human behavior

There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic

Human, human
Human behavior
Human

There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic

Human, human, human, human
