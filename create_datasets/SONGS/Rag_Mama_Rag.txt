Rag Mama rag, can't believe its true.
Rag Mama Rag, what did you do?
Crawled up to the railroad track 
Let the four nine-teen scratch my back 

Sag mama sag now 
What's come over you
Rag Mama Rag, I'm a pulling out your gag. 
Gonna turn you lose like an old caboose, 
Got a tail I need a drag. 

I ask about your turtle, 
And you ask about the weather, 
Well, I can't jump the hurdle 
And we can't get together. 

We could be relaxing in my sleeping bag,
But all you want to do for me mama 
Is rag Mama rag there's no-where to go, 
Rag Mama rag. Come on resin up the bow.

Rag Mama rag, where do ya roam?
Rag Mama rag, bring your skinny little body back home.
Its dog eat dog and cat eat mouse, you can
You can rag Mama rag all over my house. 

Hail stones beating on the roof, 
The bourbon is a hundred proof, 
Its you and me and the telephone 
Our destiny is quite well known.

We don't need to sit and brag. 
All we gotta do is 
Rag Mama rag Mama rag.
Rag Mama rag
Where do you roam?
Rag Mama rag, bring your skinny little body back home
