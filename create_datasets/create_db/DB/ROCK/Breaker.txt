Christ
Or credit
What's the price?
What's the edit?
I'm alive
I don't credit
The source
I just drive
And then the fog rolls in
And then they're blind
My enemies
They're just trying
Trying to kill me

Breaking the waves
Again and though I try
The ocean is strong
I cannot stem the tide
Breaking the waves
Again and though I try
I can't seem to stem
The tide and though I try
I try

Try me two times

I've got the time
And it's been too long
Since I've been
Driving all night
On the back roads winding
Under the stars
That are slowly dying
Oh no

Breaking the waves
Again and though I try
The ocean is strong
I cannot stem the tide
Breaking the waves
Again and though I try
I can't seem to stem
The tide and though I try
I try

Jack-knifed
On the side-street crossing
I'm still alive
And that's something
And when I die
There will be nothing to say
Except I tried
Not to waste another day
Trying to stem the tide
