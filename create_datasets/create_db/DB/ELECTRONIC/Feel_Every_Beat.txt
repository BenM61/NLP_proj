Have you ever been a victim in a violent fight
When you know it's not true and you know it's not right
Got not one ounce, inch of control

You got lust for blood runnin' in your soul
You know if every person upon this earth
Became the image of the mother in a violent birth
We could sow the seed, toss up the sand

And heal this brutal beat-up land
If there's a place to be why don't you come with me
Listen to your father, listen to your brother
Take every chance that comes, maybe you'll find someone

We don't need to argue, we just need each other
There's a mirror on the table, if you feel you could use it
Don't be ashamed, go ahead just do it
Protect your cranium, let it explode

Put your faith in the mother lode
Now if all this seems to be eccentric
Be aware be sure I meant it
The tunnel of love has got no end

I'm well received, but I don't send
