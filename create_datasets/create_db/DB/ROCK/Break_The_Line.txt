You can get it 
Come and climb under my skin 
Overtake it 
Pushing me on a fast lane 
Come lets get away 
No one knows you like I do 
We will pass it if 
You let the tires kiss the ground 
You should go ahead 
So fast 
You should go ahead 
So fast 
Break the line 
We have to go 
'Cause there's no way back 
Where we are coming from 
I'm your engine 
Got you strapped into my seat 
Here is our tactic 
We get faster 
The more I scream 
Come lets get away 
No one drives you like I do 
I'm collapsing 
When the tires kiss the ground 

You should go ahead 
So fast 
You should go ahead 
So fast 

Break the line 
We have to go 
'Cause there's no way back 
Where we are coming from 

And all I try is to break the thin line 
Nothings gonna stop the way of life 
Be sure that you are safe 
I'll show you a place 
Where we can be and everyone is dreaming of

You should go ahead 
So fast 
You should go ahead 
So fast 

Break the line 
We have to go 
'Cause there's no way back 
Where we are coming from
