Recently (Joan Baez)
Recently it all came back to me
Somebody promised us roses
We slid by for awhile on dreams
But today I see what's only a memory
Of a decade ago that vanished from sight
With the speed of a shooting star
Leaving you, leaving me, where we are...

Well, you could say we sailed on stormy seas
Or you could say that we failed like seven out
Of ten in our neighboorhood
But I prefer remembering the way we were
When we both thought the other had hung the moon
Cause too soon
Came the troubled times and the
Broken rhymes so hard to define
Till recently

Oh, I could have tried for a thousand years
Through the long and winding night
Could have cried another million tears
It would never come out right

And recently the product of all our years
Dressed in a navy blue blazer
Headed for a first class school in the East
And I'd like to say he's hardly a failure now
And neither are you on the second time round
With a wife and a family
And the roses that lately arrived
In the new baby's eyes
So recently
