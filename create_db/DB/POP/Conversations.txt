I don't know how to say this 
I don't know where to stand 
I don't where to put my feet 
Or where to put my hands 
I got them my pockets 
My fingers are freezing cold 
They're wrapped around a ticket stub 
That's four weeks old 
And I don't know how to say this 
I think we figured out 
This world is bigger than you and I 
We've exhausted our wealth, knowledge, 
Have no more answers for mankind 
And we've had every conversation in the world 
About what is right and what has all gone bad 
But have I mentioned to you that this is all I am 
This is all that I have 
And I'm not trying to judge you 
No that's not my job 
I am just a seeker, too 
In search of good 
Somewhere, somehow the subject became taboo 
I have no other way to communicate to you 
That this is all that I have, this is all that I am 
And we've had every conversation in the world 
About what is right and what has all gone bad 
But have I mentioned to you that this is all I am 
This is all that I have 
And I would like to share with you 
What makes me complete 
I don't claim to have found the truth 
But I know it has found me 
The only thing that isn't meaningless to me 
Is Jesus Christ and the way he set me free 
And this is all that I have, this is all that I am 
It's all that I have, and it's all 
The only thing that isn't meaningless to me 
Is Jesus Christ and the way he set me free 
And this is all that I have, this is all that I am 
It's all that I have, and it's all that I am 
It's all that I have, and it's all 
I don't know how to say this 
I don't know where to start 
Just know that I care for you 
And I'm speaking from my heart
