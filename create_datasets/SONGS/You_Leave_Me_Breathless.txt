You leave me breathless, you heavenly thing!
You look so wonderful, you're like a breath of Spring!
You leave me speechless, I'm just like the birds;
I'm filled with melody, but at at a loss for words!

That little grin of yours,
That funny chin of yours,
Does so much to my heart!
Oh, give your lips to me,
For, darling, that would be
The final touch to my heart!

You leave me breathless, that's all I can say!
I can't say more because you take my breath away!

That little grin of yours,
That funny chin of yours,
Does so much to my heart!
Oh, give your lips to me,
For, darling, that would be
The final touch to my heart!

You leave me breathless, that's all I can say!
I can't say more because you take my breath away!
