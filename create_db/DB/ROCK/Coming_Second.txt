Found a hole and slipped on through
Kissed the stone and learnt the lines
Jumped the cue all the time forgetting you

Best disheveled lover 3 years running
Coming second to
A picket fence white 9-5 who's
Just alive

Beyond repair, there is nothing to say
Save some fading regrets
Yet I can't be without this
I want you to be around.

Spit-shone lies, juggled debts
Planted flags and made regrets.
Muddled through all the time
Forgetting you

Cut your teeth and breezed on to
Another brothers fickle ways
So why amazed when it don't
Come turn out your way
