It's the end of a broken imaginary time
It didn't stay long
Your famous superficial golden tan

When It comes down to dust
You're such a lightweight after all
When it comes down to dust
You're such a lightweight after all
You're such a lightweight after all
You're such a nobody at all

It's the end of a broken imaginary time
It didn't last long
Your famous superficial golden tan

When It comes down to dust
You're such a lightweight after all
When it comes down to dust
You're such a lightweight after all
You're such a lightweight after all
You're such a nobody at all...
