I'ma make it hot like fire
I'ma make it hot like fire  
I'ma make it hot like fire

Your hotter than summer day, in California 
You got me melting like a sundae, and I want ya 
I know you've been wait-you've been waiting a long time for me (for me) 
But if you wait a little while longer this is how it'll be

Oh it's gonna be 
Hot like fire 
I'm gonna take you, take you higher 
You can't resist, 
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss

You shouldn't rush it, take our time 
I'll let you know when I'm ready (if that's alright) 
I won't keep you, I won't keep you, I won't keep you holding on 
But if you wait on me, I promise you it won't be long 

(Oh it's gonna be) 
Hot like fire 
I'm gonna take you, take you higher 
You can't resist
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss 
I'm gonna make it
Hot like fire 
And I'm gonna take you
Take you higher(no you won't resist oh) 
You can't resist, 
Kiss, kiss, and kiss, and kiss, and kiss

Baby take your time 
Take your time, don't move too fast (no no no) 
Take your time, there's no rushing babe, no no no 
Take your time (whoa take your time) 
Take your time 
I'm gonna make it all good for you, baby

Hot like fire
And I'm gonna take you, take you higher 
No no no, you won't resist
You can't resist, (when I taste your lips) 
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss

Hot like fire (no no no no) 
Take you higher (no no no no)   
You can't resist (no no no no) 
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss (no no no no)
