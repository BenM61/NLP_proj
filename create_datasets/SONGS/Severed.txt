I alight like a whisper
I alight with the lights out
And it won't take me long just to find you
And it won't take me long just to find you

I'm allied to the winter
But don't you get clever
Don't you get clever
I'm allied to the landslide
Gonna leave you all severed
Gonna leave you all severed

I alone am the answer
I alone will make wrongs right
But in order to root out the cancer
It's got to be kept from the sight

I'm allied to the winter
But don't you get clever
Don't you get clever
I'm allied to the landslide
Gonna leave you all severed
Gonna leave you all severed

I was born to a jackal
I was born in a whiteout
Gonna smother you all till I choke you
Gonna smother you all till you kick out

I'm allied to the winter
But don't you get clever
Don't you get clever
I'm allied to the landslide
Gonna leave you all severed
Gonna leave you all severed
