Hey girl, you got me walking in the dark 
I've got a feeling that my heart is just your game 
'Cause you and I, we were so happy at the start 
But you've been playing much to hard for me to take 

How could you lie to me 
Your actions don't vouch for what you say 
I'm just like a child at play and your love's a toy you tried to take away from me 
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play

It's hard to say the things I feel for you today 
But now I know my heart will never be the same 
Girl I'm no toy for you to play with everyday 
I'll show you just the kind of game I like to play 

How could you lie to me 
Your actions don't vouch for what you say 
I'm just like a child at play and your love's a toy you tried to take away from me 
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play

Stop you can't lie to me anymore 
Stop you can't lie to me anymore 
Stop you can't lie to me anymore 
Stop you can't lie to me anymore 

No, no, no, no more lies  
No, no, no, no more lies  
No, no, no, no more lies  
No, no, no, no more lies  

Like a child at play 
Like a child at play 
Like a child at play 
Like a child at play 

Like a child at play 
Like a child at play 
Like a child at play 
Like a child at play
