He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet, with his same old safe bet
Me and my head high and my tears dry, get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far, from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track, my arms are stacked
I go back to black

We only said goodbye with words, I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to, I go back to us

I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pie 
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words, I died a hundred times
You go back to her, and I go back to

We only said goodbye with words, I died a hundred times
You go back to her, and I go back to

Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black

I go back to, I go back to

We only said goodbye with words, I died a hundred times
You go back to her, and I go back to

We only said goodbye with words, I died a hundred times
You go back to her, and I go back to black
