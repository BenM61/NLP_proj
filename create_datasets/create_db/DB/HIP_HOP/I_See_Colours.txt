Prince Paul already used this loop
But I'ma keep it movin' and put you up on the scoop
I first saw the world in 78
Around the same time rap music source first played
Nowadays my name should be the kingpin with words
Kids should drop my personality like King Tim the third
Word to the fat back queen with the sugar hills
I should be splicing verse without the payment of a dollar bill
I gots to chill though or think about sex
'Cause if whiskey fills my third leg
Or should I say the second neck?
Connect the dots with all the faggots making records
Who couldn't suck a dick or put the gloss on the upper lip
They can't f*ck with this I'm just too vivid
Like rainbows falling out the sky and turn liquid
My word systems turn your scene to tangerine
The kid sees colors flashing wild on his movie screen

Red and yellow and pink and green
Purple and orange and blue
I can sing a rainbow
I can sing a rainbow

I love most brothers but someone told me that I burn bridges
I simply use a rapper's bones to build to build my third niche
I work with the aesthetic of a brain medic
Cutting up the reels with crystal shards to make the tape edit
I take lettuce, onions, tomatoe
Add a dab of mayo plus the fish fillet-o
Appetizing gray matter with a strange platter
The symmetry of energy with chemistry and plasma
After you latch on to lost masters
Come back to re-evaluate the now chapter
Style masters born to make classics
And paint canvas geometric break dances
The almighty made Saturn caves and caverns
The flames of magma rivers in Niagara
All of this beauty can be yours to discover
Can't you see it brother?
Without the LSD I see colors

Red and yellow and pink and green
Purple and orange and blue
I can sing a rainbow
I can sing a rainbow

Red and Yellow and gray and black
All the colors that represent my past
But now they're just a part of
The shadows of my mind
