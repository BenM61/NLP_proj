Pretty as a midsummer's morn,
They call her Dawn

Dawn,
Go away I'm no good for you
Oh Dawn,
Stay with him, he'll be good to you
Hang on,
Hang on to you

Think,
What a big man he'll be
Think,
Of the places you'll see
Now think what the future would be with a poor boy like me
Dawn go away,
Please go away
Although I know,
I want you to stay
Dawn go away,
Please go away
Baby, don't cry
It's better this way
Ahh, ahh, ah
Ohh-ohh-oh

Dawn,
Go away I'm no good for you
Oh Dawn,
Stay with him, he'll be good to you
Hang on,
Hang on to you

Dawn,
Go away back where you belong
Girl we can't,
Change the places where we were born
Before you say,
That you want me
I want you to think,
What your family would say
Think,
What your throwing away
Now think what the future would be with a poor boy like me
Meee-ee

Dawn,
Go away I'm no good for you
Oh Dawn,
Stay with him, he'll be good to you
Hang on,
Hang on to you

Dawn,
Go away I'm no good for you
Dawn,
Go away I'm no good for you
