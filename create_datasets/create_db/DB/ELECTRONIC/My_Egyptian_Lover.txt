My Egyptian lover... 

I see your girl 
But she don't do it like me 
She's not that type 
I see it in your eyes 
You need a freak 
Someone to keep your secret 
A girl like me (Uhuh)
Who knows what's on your mind 

You know I'm hot (Ow!) 
I see you looking at me 
Stop wasting time (Yeah) 
And come with me tonight 
Stop spending money on me 
Make up your mind 
If you're coming home with me 
You're running out of time! (Ahh) 

My egyptian lover 
(My egyptian lover) 
There is no other 
(My egyptian lover) 
My egyptian lover 
(My egyptian lover) 
There is no other 
(There is no other!) 

I see you boy 
But you don't holla at me 
I think you're shy 
I'll show you what to do 
I'll be your dog (Woof) 
Come to you when you call me 
Just close your eyes (Uhuh) 
And dance with me tonight 

You make me hot (Ow!) 
You got me goin' crazay 
You're on my mind (Yeah) 
And make my heart go boom 
Stop acting shady on me 
And wasting time 
Then you can take me on your magic carpet ride (Aohh!) 

My egyptian lover 
(My egyptian lover) 
There is no other 
(My egyptian lover) 
My egyptian lover 
(My egyptian lover) 
There is no other 
(There is no other!)
