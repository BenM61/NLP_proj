There's a crack in the rainbow
There's a hole in the sky
You believed in something
Now it's just a lie, yeah

No jokes from the jester
Not a laugh from the clown
And your world is upside down, yeah

You can hide in a circle
It's a way to survive
Be another number
At least you'd be alive

Or you can ride with the gypsy
He can take you to hell
And the answers screaming
In a voice you know so well

You you're made of fire
Never higher
You were made to run

You you're burning higher
You've got the fire
You were born on the sun

So take a walk with a wild one
It's the way that I've found
You can turn it upside down
