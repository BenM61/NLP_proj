Do you ever know how the child lies
When the child is going so red
Do you ever know have you ever known
Have you ever known
I'm a liar
Do you ever know do you ever know
Have you ever know I'm a liar

Have you ever known
Have you ever known
Have you ever known
I'm a liar

Lower your mind and recline, perfect in mind, you to me babe
The way of wine you opened me then showed me loving
If you ever say you might, if so reply, if only you might,
Yeah well you're keeping my head fading where you lay girl

Do you ever know how the child lies
When the child is going so red
Do you ever know have you ever known
Have you ever known
I'm a liar
Do you ever know do you ever know
Have you ever know I'm a liar

Lower your mind girl, baby you, open your mind, you to me
Lower your mind baby your soul your mind your eyes
If you ever say you might if so replay if only baby
That what you say you might just open me, you lie

Do you ever know how the child lies
When the child is going so red
Do you ever know have you ever known
Have you ever known
I'm a liar
Do you ever know have you ever know
Have you ever know I'm a liar

Do you ever know have you ever know
Have you ever know I'm a liar

Do you ever know have you ever know
Have you ever know I'm a liar

Do you ever know have you ever know
Have you ever know I'm a liar

Do you ever know have you ever know
Have you ever know I'm a liar

Do you ever know have you ever know
Have you ever know
