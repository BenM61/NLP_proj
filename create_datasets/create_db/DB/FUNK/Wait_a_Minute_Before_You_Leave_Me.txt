Just sixty seconds of your time
To listen to this plea of mine
Don't let your heart be made of stone
Just say the past is bygone
Wait a minute before you leave me
Hold on before you go

I know that I was such a fool
I used your heart just like a tool
I'll be your puppet on a string
And, baby, I'll do anything

Turn around
Don't walk out that door
I want you, baby, more than before
Wait a minute before you leave me
Hold on before you go

Oh, oh, wait a minute, baby
(Wait a minute before you leave me)
Hold on (Hold on before you go)
Wait a minute, baby
(Wait a minute before you leave me)
Hold on (Hold on before you go)

If I must beg to keep you by my side
I'm not ashamed to give up my pride
Wait a minute before you leave me
Hold on before you go

I left you standing all alone
You reached for me and I was gone
In other words, I was unwise
And for this I apologize

Baby, please, please, hurry
Say you forgive me
I'm beginning to worry
Wait a minute before you leave me
Hold on before you go

Oh wait a minute, baby, hold on
Wait a minute, baby, hold on
I didn't mean to hurt you, oh, hold on, baby
Wait, wait, wait a minute, baby
Hold on before you go
