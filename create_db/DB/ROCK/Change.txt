I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You're on fire
I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
And you feel so alive
I have watched you change

I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed
I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I have watched you change

It's like you never had wings
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah

I look at the cross
And I look away
Give you the gun
Blow me away

I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I have watched you change
And you feel alive
You feel alive
You feel alive
I have watched you change
It's like you never had wings

Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah

You change
You change
You change
