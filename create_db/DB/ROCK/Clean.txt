The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

And the rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
By morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
It came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
By morning, gone was any trace of you, gone was any trace of you
Oh, gone was any trace of you, gone was any trace of you
Oh, gone was any trace, gone was any trace
Gone was any trace of you, gone was any trace of you, oh
