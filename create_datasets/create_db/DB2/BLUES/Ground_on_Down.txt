I believe in a few things
God the devil and love
Cause I've looked up from the bottom
And I've stared down from above

I have faith in a few things
Divinity and grace
But even when I'm on my knees
I know the devil prays

And you're working your way
From the ground on down

I hate to say I love you
Because it means that I
Will be with you forever
Or will sadly say goodbye

I love to say I hate you
Because it means that I
Will live my life happily without you
Or will sadly live a lie

And you're working your way
From the ground on down

Life is short
And if your lookin' for extension
With your time
You had best do well

Cause there's good deeds
And there is good intention
They're as far apart
As heaven and hell

And you're working your way
From the ground on down
