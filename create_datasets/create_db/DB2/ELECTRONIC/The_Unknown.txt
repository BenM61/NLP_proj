They were times
When I set alone
Pulling myself
Away from the unknown

Patterns of life
What we see and feel
On the other side
Knowing what is real

My other self
I'm trying to hide
Forbidden doors
On the other side

On the other side
Away from the unknown
Away from the unknown
Away from the unknown ...

They were times
When I set alone
Pulling myself
Away from the unknown

Heavy silence
When the darkness falls
My secret hide away
Without any rules

My other self
I'm trying to hide
Forbidden doors
On the other side

On the other side
Away from the unknown
Away from the unknown
Away from the unknown ...

They were times
What we see and feel
On the other side
