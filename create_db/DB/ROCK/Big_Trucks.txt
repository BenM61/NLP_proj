Dad, dad, why did you let that man
Push you around like that?
You should have beat him down
Down to the ground for that
He said son, you're still young
And you always jump the gun
There's real people in the big, big trucks
That you flip off when they get in your way
They're so high that you pay no mind
To the big, big sign that says 'oversize load'
Do you really think they can go as fast as you 
In your '87 Trans Am
They know you're in such a terrible rush
But they're going just as fast, as fast as they can
Dad, dad, I really don't understand
What driving big trucks has to do with that man
You shoulda taught him a lesson
About being rude, about talking to you with such an attitude
He said son, you're still young
And you always jump the gun
There's real people in the big, big trucks
That you flip off when they get in the way
They're so high that you pay no mind
To the sign that says 'oversize load'
Do you really think they can go as fast as you
In your '87 Trans Am
They know you're in such a terrible rush
But they're going just as fast, as fast as they can
