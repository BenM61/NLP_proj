Too much of heaven,
Can bring you underground
Heaven, can always turn around.
Too much of heaven,
A life and soul hell bound.
Heaven, the killer makes no sound.

They're still talking about money,
That's right and too much of heaven.
C'mon my friend.

Let me tell you what it's all about,
It's called money dependence today,
And people just keep on going on
Looking at the dollar bill,
And nothing else around them.
No love, no friendship, nothing else,
Just the dollar bill coming on into their pocket,
Into their account,
And that's too much of heaven
Bringing them underground.
Let me tell you what it's all about
It's called money dependence today,
And people just keep on going on
Looking at the dollar bill,
And nothing else around them.
No love, no friendship, nothing else,
Just the dollar bill coming on into their pocket,
Into their account,

The answer,
Is blowing in the wind.
The answer is blowing.

Oh let me tell you what it's all about.
Too much of heaven bring you underground
