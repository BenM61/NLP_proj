Her heart gets broken, it's something she can't hide
She's cut like a diamond from a mine as deep as time
The words that she's spoken have energized my mind
A sheer elevation so like eagles high we'll glide

Hot love it smolders, it's something she can't hide
A manifestation of a force as old as time
Now morning has broken and solarized my eyes
Her sheer dispensation says like eagles high we'll glide

Solarized in the sunrise
Solarized in the sunrise
Rise with the sunrise
Solarized in the sunrise
Solarized in the sunrise
Rise with the sunrise

The light that she lives for in the dark she'll always find
