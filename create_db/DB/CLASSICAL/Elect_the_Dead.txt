Arms are raised above the sky,
But all I want is me

You are there beside the night
But I all I want is me
All I want is me.

Love we know
Comes from inside,
But all I want is me,
All I want is me.

Death we know
Comes to us alive
But all I want is you,

Death we know
Comes to all of us alive
But all I want is you,
All I need is you,
All I want.
