My man don't love me
Treats me oh so mean
My man he don't love me
Treats me awfully
He's the lowest man
That I've ever see

He wears high trimmed pants
Stripes are really yellow
He wears high trimmed pants
Stripes are really yellow
But when he starts in to love me
He's so fine and mellow

Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Love will make you do things
That you know is wrong

But if you treat me right baby
I'll stay home everyday
If you treat me right baby
I'll stay home everyday
But you're so mean to me baby
I know you're gonna drive me away

Love is just like the faucet
It turns off and on
Love is like the faucet
It turns off and on
Sometimes when you think it's on baby
It has turned off and gone
