I saw an old friend of ours today
she asked about you
I didn't quite know what to say
heard you've been making the rounds
'round here
while i've been trying to make tears disappear...

Now i'm almost over you
i've almost shook these blues
so when you come back around
after painting the town, you'll see
i'm almost over you...

You're such a sly one with your cold, cold heart
maybe leaving came easy
but it tore me apart
time heals all wounds, they say
and I should know
'cause it seems like forever
but i'm letting you go...

Now i'm almost over you
i've almost shook these blues
so when you come back around
after painting the town, you'll see
i'm almost over you...

I can forgive you and soon i'll forget
all those shattered dreams
although you've left me with nothing to show
full of misery...

Now i'm almost over you
i've almost shook these blues
so when you come back around
after painting the town, you'll see
i'm almost over you...
