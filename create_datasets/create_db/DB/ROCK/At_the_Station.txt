I was standin' at the station
Out at the end of the line 
Feelin' mad, just a bit impatient 
And I wish that you would make up my mind 

Yes, I was out there on the platform 
Pay phone keeps eatin' my dimes 
And I still don't have an answer 
And the train's leavin' right on time 

I'm fallin' down 
I'm fallin' down 

Standin' at the station 
Won the battle, here I am, 
Standin' at the station 
Like a general just relieved of command 

I'm fallin' down 
I'm fallin' down
