Woohoo
I was walking down the street the other day
Who did I meet?

I met a friend of mine and he did say
Man, I can smell your feet a mile away

Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away
Smile away, smile away, smile away, yeah smile away

I was walking down the street the other day
Ah, who did I meet?
I met a friend of mine and he did say
