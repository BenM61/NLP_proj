Hard nine to five, we go out tonight
Acting like we're best of friends but it's a lie
What do I do, about me and you?
I know it's mutual oh and it's so hard to fight

When you look in my eyes
I'm looking at you when I shouldn't tonight
So what do I do?
'Cause you caught a guy

If it was up to me
Then I guarantee I'd make you mine
There's nowhere else I rather be, rather be
Than by your side
So I hope he keeps you satisfied
You don't know what you're doing to me, doing to me
You don't know what you're doing to me, doing to me
You don't know what you're doing to me, doing to me

So let's cut the ties
And stop floating with the fiction in my mind
Reality keeps telling me
Maybe if I met you first then you'd be mine

When you look in my eyes
I'm looking at you when I shouldn't tonight
So what do I do?
'Cause you caught a guy

If it was up to me
Then I guarantee I'd make you mine
There's nowhere else I rather be, rather be
Than by your side
So I hope he keeps you satisfied
You don't know what you're doing to me, doing to me
You don't know what you're doing to me, doing to me
You don't know what you're doing to me, doing to me

There's nowhere, there's nowhere I'd rather be
There's nowhere, there's nowhere I'd rather be
There's nowhere, there's nowhere I'd rather be

When you look in my eyes
I'm looking at you when I shouldn't tonight
So what do I do?
'Cause you caught a guy

If it was up to me
Then I guarantee I'd make you mine
There's nowhere else I rather be, rather be
Than by your side
So I hope he keeps you satisfied
You don't know what you're doing to me

If it was up to me
Then I guarantee I'd make you mine
There's nowhere else I rather be, rather be
Than by your side
So I hope he keeps you satisfied
You don't know what you're doing to me, doing to me
