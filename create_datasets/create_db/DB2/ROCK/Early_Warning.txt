Too young to know 
Too old to listen 

You live your life inside a day dream 
Your lovers pride worn like a costume 
Too blind to see what you're missing 

Well if you love yourself in the morning 
Loosen up your little bow tie 
You know you gave me an early warning 
Early warning 

Wall to wall mirrors in your bathroom 
You can see yourself dressing with your back turned 
You love your wife 'cause she's a challenge 
You love your wife 'cause she's a challenge 

Well if you love yourself in the morning 
Loosen up your little bow tie 
You know you gave me an early warning 
Early warning 

Too young to know, ha ha yeah 
Too young, too old to listen 

Say if you love yourself in the morning 
Loosen up your little bow tie 
You know you gave me an early warning 
Early warning 

Say if you love yourself in the morning 
Loosen up your little bow tie 
You know you gave me an early warning 
Early warning 

You know you gave me an early warning 
You know you gave me an early warning 

Ah loosen up
