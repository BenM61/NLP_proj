Bored on Friday night, spinning round just like I'm hypnotized, oh
Need some neon lights, wanna feel like I'm electrified, so help me out
Get your boyfriend's car, come and pick me up
Oh, let's take it for a ride
What trouble can we find?

One night and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feelin' so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs, we act so shameless
(Come on, let's lose control, like!)

One night and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feelin' so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs, we act so shameless
Just like we're famous (oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
Just like we're famous

Blown up like balloons, purple glitter flying through the air, oh
Sweat drips from the roof, hangin' out with Lucy in the sky of diamonds
Music playing loud, take me through the crowd, oh
Put your sunglasses on, don't care if we look dumb

One night and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feelin' so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs, we act so shameless
(Come on, let's lose control, like!)

One night and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feelin' so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs, we act so shameless
Just like we're famous (oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)

Just like we're famous (oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)

Just like we're famous

One night and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feelin' so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs, we act so shameless
Just like we're famous

Just like we're famous (oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)

Just like we're famous
