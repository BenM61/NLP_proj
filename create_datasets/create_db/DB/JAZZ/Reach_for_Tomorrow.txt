Reach for tomorrow
Today belongs to the past
The golden hopes of your yesterdays
Can all be yours at last

Reach for tomorrow
And keep your head in the sky
You may get hurt
In a thousand ways
But give it one more try

Have no regret about
Forget about
The chances you missed
In days to come
I know there's something
Better than this

Reach for tomorrow
And keep your dreams ever new
No matter how many times it seems
That dreams are not for you

Reach for tomorrow
And make them all come true
