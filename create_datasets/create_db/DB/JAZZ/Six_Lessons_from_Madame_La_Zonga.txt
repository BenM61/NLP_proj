Six lessons from Madame La Zonga
You do the Rumba and the new La Conga
Six lessons in Madame's cabana
And you will imagine you're down in Havana
 
Her four Latin daughters will help you to start
While finding the rhythm you might lose your heart
 
Six lessons from Madame La Zonga
And you'll develop your hip and your knee
And say, by the way, if you're sure it's okay
If Madame likes you, the lessons are free
 
Rosita gives you lesson one,
Chiquita gives you lesson two
Madame gives you all the rest
And her methods are the best
 
The Madame shows you how to walk
The Madame marks it with her chalk
When the Madame starts to squawk
That's her Cuban double talk
 
Six lessons from Madame La Zonga
And you'll develop your hip and your knee
And say, by the way, if your sure it's OK
If Madame likes you, the lessons are free
If Madame likes you, the lessons are free!
