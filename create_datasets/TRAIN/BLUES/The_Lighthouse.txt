Darkness is a message on the sea
Light is like a life to the men below
And when your beam is shone on me
I get a magic glow
Could it be the light that's in you?
Could it my big, brown eyes?
Why does my light go on shining?
How come the darkest nights stay away?

Moonlight is a message for the soul
Spirit on a cross in a raging sea
And when your gift is given slow
You put a spell on me
Could it be your winking eye, love
Lightning up an empty road?
Why does my light go on shining?
How come the darkest nights stay away?
