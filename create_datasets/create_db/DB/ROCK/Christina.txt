I am the toughest man alive
I have to struggle to survive
I have to live my life with you

This is the closest I'll ever be
To having a death-sentence over me
Having to share my bed with you

I'm anxious what it is all about
Hunger for ripping my heart out
No matter how loud I scream and shout

Tell me that you love me so we'll always be together
Promise, you will never leave me, Christina
Tell me that you love me so we'll always be together
Promise, you will never leave me, Christina

You're the most scary girl I know
People fright everywhere you go
I am an angel next to you

And everytime we go out it's a mess
Turmoil and scandal in the crest
And everything they write, you know, it's true
(It's true!)

Tell me that you love me so we'll always be together
Promise, you will never leave me, Christina
Tell me that you love me so we'll always be together
Promise, you will never leave me, Christina

Tell me that you love me so we'll always be together
Promise, you will never leave me, Christina

Tell me that you love me so we'll always be together
Promise you will never leave me, Christina
Tell me that you love me so we'll always be together
Promise you will never leave me, Christina
One day when I'm gone, you will remember all those
Moments we had, together, Christina
One day when I'm gone, you will remember all those
Moments we had, forever, Christina

One day when I'm gone, you will remember all those
Moments we had, together, Christina
One day when I'm gone, you will remember all those
Moments we had, forever, Christina
One day when I'm gone, you will remember all those
Moments we had, together, Christina
