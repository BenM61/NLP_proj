Why must my teenage heart keep sharing you
Why must my teenage heart feel blue
And if I spend my whole life sharing you
My teenage love will still be true
But when you're by his side my foolish pride
Won't let my feelings through
'Cause you're breaking my teenage heart in two

I know I won't be sharing you
Till then my teenage heart will wait for you
My teenage love will still be true

So if you need a love and hand to hold
I'll wait here just for you
But you're breaking my teenage heart in two
Yes you are
You're breaking my teenage heart in two
