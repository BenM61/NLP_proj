Your feet on the dashboard
Parked outside your parents house
Don't open the door yeah
There's more than one way to get out

Yeah, we can go somewhere where no one knows us
Overdose on open roads, yeah
Cheap hotels we'll dance on tables 
In every town from here to Vegas

If we were the stars in a movie somehow
This would be the step up where it all goes wrong
It'll be alright if we just

Drive

If we just drive
Drive

We got all that we need, yeah
Money, cigarettes and just enough love
To get through the weekend 
We'll sleep when Monday's sun comes up
