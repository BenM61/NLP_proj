Now, I found, that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday

Living tomorrow, where in the world will I be tomorrow?
How far am I able to see?
Or am I needed here?

Now, I found, that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday

If I remember all of the things I have done
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong
Why do they keep me here?

Now, I found, that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
Now, I found, that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
Now, I found, that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
Now, I found, that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
