I got that work, f*** Labor Day, just bought a gun
F*** punching in, throwing rocks, no hopscotch
Bet my 9 milli hit the right spot
Bang, last night it was a dream
This morning a fantasy
Back when the only fan I had was a fiend
Meet me by the Acura cause the cops like
To get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea
But it's cool I've been catching on to they formula
See I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'
Then rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo
The bad guy never once been a hoes hero
He get zero, I said nada
B**** pa** the cama (Uh, yeah)
How'd it feel to be a real n****? (I'm a product of a real n****)
La-la familia (Get confronted by a real n****)
F*** with one of my real n****s
(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real n****?
(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real n**** (My whole life I've been a real n****)
La-la familia (Get confronted by a real n****)
F*** with one of my real n****s
(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real n****?

I done jumped off my a**
Hit the lick and barely pa** but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him

But, every last one of us had a pistol in the room, n****
But, click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, n****)
But, meet Glock clock familia (Boom)

Find a n**** realer than me, my socks stink
Eat so much p**** that my mustache pink
Strapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt
Gangsta lean help, hoodie on backwards with the eyes cut out
My hate felt, my .45 elder, poetry's deep
I never fail ya, Schoolboy bust flame
Orange-yellow, higher than Margiela's
Since a young n**** I admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal
From his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout
Think about it, the smoker ain't got s*** and everyday he still get a hit
Whether jacking radio's or sucking dick
Sell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips
'Cause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much
To get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't f***ing with work
Unless we rewind and answer my church
Times getting harder than my dick on a growth spurt
Around the same time all you n****s was on purp
My sober a** was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck freeze
Give me the keys, extra Frito's, chili and cheese
Thew some Baby Lucas in his eyes before I leave
The cops'll never get the leak, grandma taught me well
And my uncle gun was the accessories, 211 sipping plus a robbery
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome

I done jumped off my a**
Hit the lick and barely pa** but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him

But, every last one of us had a pistol in the room, n****
But, click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, n****)
But, meet Glock clock familia (Boom)

Grandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more
She always got me things that we couldn't afford
The new J's and Tommy Hill in my drawers
Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, see Golden Eye was away at war
We wasn't thinking of getting money then
Nor did I wonder why my uncle done sold his Benz
'Cause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down
I also notice moms be locking doors when he around
But anyways, his wife done left him and now he living with us
My bike is missing, grandma light a hotter chick every month
My uncle's nuts, he used to give me Whisky to piss in cups
Knocking on the door telling me to hurry up, he in a rush
I gave it to him then got my a** whipped for doing it
Moms used to tell me like "N****, know who you dealing with"
Them was the good days 'til I was raised the older ways
Rat-Tone my n****s' brother showed me my first K
I was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back, he called us over like "Hey"
Yak, yak, yak, yak! We like "Damn, n****"
Then again, yak, yak! We like "Damn, n****"
Hearing him say 'cause turned us to a fan, n****
Later on he got locked so know we're taking his fades
Continue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page
Gangbanging was a ritual and grandma would help
She should've never left her gun on the shelf
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome

I done jumped off my a**
Hit the lick and barely pa** but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him

But, every last one of us had a pistol in the room, n****
But, click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, n****)
But, meet Glock clock familia (Boom)
