I heard you speak to me
The words I can't repeat
The words I can't repeat
The seat beside the tree
I hope you're there tonight

Aiming for your head, get down
You're the only one around
You're the only one in town

Just like the record store
That I can't go no more
There's too much choice and not enough time
To find what's mine

Aiming for your, get down
You're the only one around
You're the only one in town
