My heart is a flower
That blooms every hour
I believe in the power
Of love

Well in this lonesome meadow
Well it's soft as a pillow
Oh I pray that we'll go back
To love

I'm going to reach on up over that fear
And whenever I'm alone won't you please be near
I know that darkness before the dawn
Tomorrow's coming and yesterday's gone

I'm going to get my baby
Get up stream
Fall asleep in her arms
And drift away in a dream

Gonna go out walking in the morning light
Well I know that my tomorrow's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright

Well I never shall wither
Well of course I forgive her
Oh please Lord deliver me

To love

I'm going to reach on up over that fear
And whenever I'm alone won't you please be near
I know that darkness before the dawn
Tomorrow's coming and yesterday's gone

I'm going to get my baby
Get up stream
Fall asleep in her arms
And drift away in a dream

Gonna go out walking in the morning light
Well I know that my tomorrow's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
Gonna be alright

Yeah
My heart is a flower
That blooms every hour
I believe in the power
I believe in the power
Of love, love, of love
