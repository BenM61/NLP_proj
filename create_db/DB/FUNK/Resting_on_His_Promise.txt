My Father promised to supply all my needs
With His riches in glory
He gives seed to the barren
And food to famine
So I know that He'll take care of me 
So I know that He'll take care of me 

Jireh, who He is
Providing is, what He does
He won't let me lack, won't let me beg
Cause I'm His child, and He loves me

I'm resting on His promise
I know He's working it out for me
I'm resting on His promise
I know, that God is covering me

My Fathers' rich, in houses and land
All power is in His hand
No recession, depression, or repossession
And with hope, the blessings He has for me

Jireh, who He is
Providing is, what He does
He won't let me lack, won't let me beg
Cause I'm His child, and He loves me

I'm resting on His promise
I know He's working it out for me
I'm resting on His promise
I know, that God is covering me

Go to sleep at night, don't worry
Your bills will be paid
Ways will be made
Put you mind at ease
Cause your Father
Won't leave nor forsake you

Go to sleep at night, don't worry
Doors will be opened
That you thought were closed
Put you mind at ease
Cause your father will
Never leave you nor forsake you

We just come to stamp notice on the devil
That no matter what happens, we're gonna be okay
'Cause we're covered by the blood of Jesus
and no weapon that is formed against us is going to be able to prosper
And no crime will come near our dwelling place

Your covered, don't you worry
Your covered, don't you worry
Rest, on His promise
Rest, on His promise

I'm covered, don't you worry
I'm covered, don't you worry
Rest, on His promise
Rest, on His promise

I'm still singing, I'm still shouting
I'm still dancing, I'm still praising

I'm covered, I'm not worried
I'm covered, I'm not worried

I'm covered
