Ch- When your around I can see so clearly through the
Rain; 
There's something bout' the way that you hold me, keeps
Me into you that is why I know gotta be the one for me.

Verse1-This must be divine intervention.
Heaven must know that I need you, see first I tried so
Hard to refrian from it somehow, love made it's way, 
Straight to my heart.


Verse2- Soon I shall not I try to act, frontin' as if
I really wasn't interested in you, had every excuse I
Could come up with but I was just afraid to commit, 
Take a look inside my world and you'll probably find a
Scared little girl.

ConyaDoss-I know. Gotta be yeah. oooooh. gotta be.

Verse3-Took a little time set my pride aside (repeat),
Verse3-Took a little time set my pride aside (repeat),
Verse3-Took a little time set my pride aside (repeat),
I'm so very glad that you chose to stay with me, I'm so
Glad that you chose to stay with me, if you wanna leave
I don't know wherd I be, your my everything my love is
Complete.

Oooh yeah. (chorus1x)

ConyaDoss Spoken:Gotta be the one, I respect you baby
All the good you do.I love you babe, Dah Dah, la la la
I believe in you, I trust you baby.
