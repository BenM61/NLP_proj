I see you walking with a halo, cover it up
Yeah cover it up, my baby
No need to try and be a hero, I've had enough
Yeah I've had enough, my baby
You got a little bit of Tarzan, let it all out
Yeah let it all out my baby
You see the thrill is in the chase, I wanna find out
I wanna find out my baby

You're always so nice, I'm getting bored
You say the right things, I'm getting bored
And you always call first, I'm getting bored
Yeah I'm getting bored

(Ah) So sick of the good boys, need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
(Ah) No time for the right one, need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love

You wanna treat me like a lady, don't even try
No, don't even try my baby
Ain't gotta say that you need me, keep it inside
Yeah, keep it inside my baby
I know I sound a little twisted and baby I am
Or maybe I'm not, but baby
Playing the game is so addictive, want it to stop
Don't want it to stop my baby

You're always so nice, I'm getting bored
You say the right things, I'm getting bored
And you always call first, I'm getting bored
Yeah I'm getting bored

(Ah) So sick of the good boys, need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
(Ah) No time for the right one, need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love

Yeah
When you put your clothes back on
Something always feels so wrong

Baby, all I'm thinking of
Is I want your dirty love

(Ah) So sick of the good boys, need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
(Ah) No time for the right one, I need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love

(Ah) So sick of the good boys, need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
(Ah) No time for the right one, I need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love (ah)
