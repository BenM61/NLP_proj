Dancin' on the speakers, are you peakin' with the tweekers?
Bigots and the breeders on the scene
The night don't last forever so get your shit together
Open arms are never what they seem

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

I don't need a doctor, just a simple love concocter
To slide to my sounds so simply
No talk or commitment, when I receive a shipment
Oh, I need express delivery

Any which way, any which way
Better take me any which way you can
Any which way, any which way
You better take me any which way you can

You don't need reservations
No identification
To give me your relations
Sting me like a bee
Oh, I want you to funk me
Your battleship has sunk me
Dip me and you dunk me
Set my body free

Any which way, any which way
Better take me any which way you can
Any which way, any which way
You better take me any which way you can

You know, baby, when I was taking my pantyhose out of their egg this evening
I thought, I'm gonna find that man who's the right shade of bottle tan
A man that smells like cocoa butter and cash, take me any way you like it
In front of the fireplace, in front of your yacht, in front of my parents
I don't give a damn, baby, just take me

Any which way, any which way, any which way you can
Any which way, any which way you can
Any which way, any which way, any which way you can
Any which way, any which way you can

Any which way, any which way
Better take me any which way you can
Any which way, any which way
You better take me any which way you can

Oh any which way you can
Oh any which way you can

Any which way, any which way
Better take me any which way you can
Any which way, any which way
You better take me any which way you can

Any which way, any which way
Better take me any which way you can
Any which way, any which way
You better take me any which way you can
