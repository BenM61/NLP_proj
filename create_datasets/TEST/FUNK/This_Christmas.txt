Hang all the mistletoe.
I'm gonna get to know you better this Christmas.
And as we trim the tree, 
How much fun it's gonna be together this Christmas.
The fireside is blazing bright.
We're caroling through the night.
And this Christmas will be a very special Christmas for me.

Presents and cards are here.
My world is filled with cheer and you this Christmas.
And as I look around, your eyes outshine the town, 
They do this Christmas.
The fireside is blazing bright.
We're caroling through the night.
And this Christmas will be a very special Christmas for me.

(This Christmas will be so special for me.)
Merry Christmas.

Oh. The fireside is blazing bright.
We're caroling through the night.
And this Christmas will be a very special Christmas for me.
(This Christmas will be so special for me.)
Shake a hand, shake a hand, shake a hand.
Spread love all over the land.
Make a friend whenever you can.
It's gonna be a very special Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.
I'm gonna get to know you better this Christmas.
