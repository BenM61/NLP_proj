Gather all the good times
When they chill with me behind
I didn't have enough time
For this stuff, on my mind

Oh when you're trying to rewind
You're caught up in a never-ending circle; we play it again
And again and again
Just give me more
Just the same, just the same
We play it again
Caught up in a never-ending circle
Play it again

You're friends with the madness
Gotta give it somemore loving
Cause you can hear what the answers
You won't let, it begin
Oh when you're trying to rewind
You're caught up in a never-ending circle; we play it again
And again and again
Just give me more
Just the same, just the same
We play it again
Caught up in a never-ending circle
Play it again
I play it again
I play it again

I play it again and again and again
We play it again
Again and again

I just play it again and again
I play it again and again
I play it again and again
I play it again and again

I play it again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again
I play it again and again
And again and again
And again
