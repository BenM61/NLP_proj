I was a worm, I was a creature
I get on the ground the second I'd see you
You cannot command your love
I wasn't a catch, I wasn't a keeper
I was walking around like I was the one who found dead John Cheever
Hand and glove

So blame it on me
I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion

I see you in stations and on invitations
You'd fall into rivers with friends on the weekends
Innocent skies above
Carin at the liquor store, I can't wait to see you
I'm walking around like I was the one who found dead John Cheever
In the house of love

So blame it on me
I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
It wasn't so bad, I wasn't that sick
Got taken by love, I wasn't that quick
Foregone conclusion
It's gonna be different after tonight
You're gonna see me in a different light
It's a foregone conclusion

So blame it on me
I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
I'm already seeing stars in the air
It's a foregone conclusion
