The way you touch, you got a touch like gold,
When we kiss and you hold me in that hold,
We're full of fire fire fire fire fire.
You're so good, you make me cry. fill me up,
You fill me up like wine, I need to please you and hold you in my arms,
And feel the fire fire fire fire fire.
Ooh, when you're by my side I feel my heart is open wide 
And brand new, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Everything's gonna be alright, 'cause we have so much sun inside,
So baby it's no wonder that there ain't any other for me like you

You are marvelous & mine
You're so much more then time
Baby you fill me up so,
You're marvelous & mine

Pull me in with the treasure in those eyes
With you there's no such thing as time
There's just fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
when we kiss all that I do is sigh
We embrace end I feel like
I could die I want to hold you forever in my arms
And feel the fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.
Ooh, when you're by my side I feel my heart is open wide & brand
new, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Everything's gonna be alright, can we have so much sun inside,
So baby it's no wonder there ain't any other for me like you

You are marvelous & mine
You're so much more then time
Baby you fill me up so,
You're marvelous & mine
