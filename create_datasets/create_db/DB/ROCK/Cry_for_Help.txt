And it really hurts when I'm thinking about you
My bet is you feel the same
And it just gets worse
All these promises were cruel
But my bet is you will remain

Did I ever tell you that you shook me to the bone
When all you did was be yourself
Have I ever told you
That you move the world I'm on
And this is my cry for help

And it really hurts when I'm thinking about you
And I'm still crying from the pain
And it only goes to show that I already know
That I, yeah I guess you will remain

Did I ever tell you that you shook me to the bone
When all you did was be yourself
Have I ever told you
That you move the world I'm on
And this is my cry for help
And this is my cry for help

And it really hurts when I'm thinking about you
And that don't sit too good with me
And it just gets worse
All them promises so cruel
But my bet is you will remain

Did I ever tell you that you brought me to my knees
When all you did was be yourself
Have I ever told you
That you made my whole world bleed
And this is my cry for help
And this is my cry for help

And it really hurts when I'm thinking about you
But my bet is you will remain
And this is my cry for help
And this is my cry for help
This is me crying
And this is my cry for help
This is me crying
This is me dying
