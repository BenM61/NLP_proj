You said
Somethin' about you
That I can't explain
Compared to the other girls
You're not the same

Your hairstyle is different
Your walk is too
When you're in doubt
You ask what to do

Do what you want to
(I will love you anyway, hey)

Time you stopped listenin' to what they say
Sound the past on and live your best today
Stay out of trouble as much as you can
I'll always remain your man

Do what you want to
(I will love you anyway)
(Not just one but everyday)

In my eyes, you do no wrong
That's why I keep on singin' this song

Yours is a property that's hard to find
Whatever you do, bear this in mind
In my eyes you can do no wrong
A kiss from you makes me really strong

Do what you want to
(I will love you anyway, hey)
(I will love you anyway, hey)

(I will love you anyway, hey)
Do what you want to, baby
Do what you want to
(I will love you anyway)

Time you stopped listenin' to what they say
Sound the past on and live your best today
Stay out of trouble as much as you can
And I'll always remain your man

Do what you want to
(I will love you anyway, hey)
Do what you want to

I will love you anyway, hey
I will love you anyway, hey
I will love you anyway, hey
I will love you anyway, hey
I will love you anyway, hey
