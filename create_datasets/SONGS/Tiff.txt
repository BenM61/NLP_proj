Me and her named Tiffany
Born to breed in everything
Carrying round a prison bar
Fucking in the feathered tar
Early call the master flirts
Measuring up the pretty girls
Body buildings sickly fed
Need my TV, I need my meds
Tiffany my vanity
Compared to you, compared to me
I'm a pawn in the hype machine
You're a pawn in the caring scheme

Go ahead and play for keeps
Go ahead and play for keeps

One for tiger, one for bear
No one wants me, no one cares
Playing rough without a fight
I was yours in record time
Played my part and pressing start
You're the hero but I'm in charge
Cheating is a money maker
Shadow gloss a tricky faker
I don't want a diamond ring
Found a man, and he's found me
It's a pact like a lion's den
You come out, but you can't come in

Go ahead and play for keeps

Make a pact with my secret son
Have the bullet, he has the gun
Don't bother me to take my time
Wouldn't rush if I had what's mine
Keep it coming and keep 'em close
How he rocks me and how it shows
Take a breath before the peak
Throw the bet to hold for keeps
Do your work and let me be
I don't owe you anything
Tiffany my vanity
Compared to you, compared to me
I'm a pawn in the hype machine,
You're a pawn in the caring scheme
We will walk with the clean machine
Follow hearts and follow great big dreams

Go ahead and play for keeps
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Go ahead and play for keeps
