I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

I love you
For sentimental reasons

I hope you do believe me
I've given you my, my, my, my, my, my
Given you my heart, because I
Mmm, love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give you loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

I think of you every morning
I dream of you every, every, every, every night
And I know I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

I know, I know, I know I love, love, love, love, love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, loving heart to me
And tell me we'll never part

I think of you every morning
Can I help it if I dream of you every night?
No, no, no, no, I'm never lonely
Whenever, whenever, whenever, whenever, whenever you are in sight
I know that I love, love, love, love, love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, loving, loving heart to me
And tell me we'll never, never, never, never part

My darling I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
