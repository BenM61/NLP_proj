I'm dedicated now to your madness
The dawn will heal us
The dawn will save us
I'm medicated now with your sadness
The dawn will heal us
The dawn will save us
When the disciples were lost in their mourning
When I was lost in the secret debate
When the disciples were lost in their mourning
Never leave just agree to the pace

(The) Room with all the stars in
Planetary nebulae suffering man schizoid
(The) Fumes with all their hearts in
Pass the sun across the sky

I'm dedicated now to all the past dreams
Behind the madness the lost & sad scenes
I'd separate it now you've said you're minds clean
You breath the last gasp & lie-in dark sleep
When she deciphers the loss in the morning
When sky was lost & eclipsed by the rays
When she deciphers the loss in the morning
Never leave just agree to the pace'

(The) Room with all the stars in
Planetary nebulae suffering man schizoid
(The) Fumes with all their hearts in
Pass the sun across the sky

A hazy torpor & lazy spires to the night skies
They dig the hole to the core & ease a smile as the light glides
