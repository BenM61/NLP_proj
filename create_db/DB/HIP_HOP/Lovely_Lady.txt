Lovely lady  girl you drive me crazy 

[Kool Keith] 
I know this girl with her own crib  in isolation 
She's from Puerto Rico  half black on vacation 
Fine freak with thongs on  whup me every week 
Panties in service  the big two's make her nervous 
Hey Boo  here's lollipops  I'ma give em too you 
Bang you nice backdoors  I'ma scrape the floors 
Look at your personal  silk on the camcorder 
Then hit bedsprings  my thumb's on the tape recorder 
With big cups of Cristal, I'ma spank her well 
If I lick you there, my girlfriend, I'ma tell 
Rock your boots, and leave my style written on your cooch 
With rubber demands, condoms in your soft hands 
I got plans for booty work to catch a lapdance 
That skirt is workin, and by myself, I be jerkin.. 
.. on to the chorus 
I want that purple Cadillac with the lime green ragtop, yeah 

Lovely lady, girl you drive me crazy (3X) 

She got me open, like two big scoops of Raisin Bran 
Watchin adult films, I'm part time her freak man 
Thinkin how she's cute, I got my mask on my eye 
Lickin splits that switch and change her whole voice pitch 
"Ayyy papi, why you go so low?" 
I got scuba divin skills, the pros, stay below 
Authorizin a sign, she reflects with pantylines 
She got her hair done, apartment two the girl is mines 
Trippin down the pants, she's wearin spandex 
and flower dresses, the booty to the max apex 
I'm on my way, with Guinness Stout everyday 
Jodeci tapes, H-Town, not bring 4Play 
Couches are plush, no quickies ladies don't rush 
You know my flavor, lubricated bareback 
Stroke to get live, you melt down, when I tap the sack 
Like Kojak, detective, I got your contraceptive 
I know your perspective, if you get picked, I'm selective 
Rubbin you down, in baths, Calgon bound 
You lookin sexy smilin, in that soft nightgown 
Baby love it when I blow bubbles, kiss her stomach 
She's a dimepiece, I popped up, on the East 
The lady is ready, tell Duke I'ma rock her steady 

Lovely lady, girl you drive me crazy (3X) 

Tight BM, she want to give me her W 
Take me shoppin, do what I want to, do it when I want to do 
I play the game right, work out that back tonight 
Disco lights beam, dancin at Southside 
She got her lingerie on, sippin on ? 
Emotional status, I'm puttin tongues to the baddest 
Bitin the peaches, cherries open on the beaches 
I got her turned out, screamin in the bleachers 
Eatin ?, her friends are mad gettin jealous 
Blockin my great view, some knucklehead's down too 
Who is it Wizard? I got the address I'ma visit 
Go down solo, she workin night, at the GoGo 
New York City Ampex, she pays for my reels 
She's admire me, her pockets with tons of bills 
She lookin good comin from work 
I hope she bought me a pair of them expensive ? reels
