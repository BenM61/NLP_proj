Thought I was cool when I played in school for all my family
Had a smile, for quite a while but now I finally see
All the girls at your feet made you want to play for free
Now I know they got my soul
I was too damn blind to see

Skullduggery, skullduggery
Skullguggery, skullduggery

Outta sight, everything's alright are the words that fed my head
Don't look now, if you turn around you might just wind up dead
Got our crew and look it fool, the gun's aimed at your head
Play all night, better get it right tomorrow call the feds

Skullduggery, skullduggery
Skullguggery, skullduggery

It's too late baby but it's alright 
'Cause we're gonna make it with you tonight
The world outside's livin' all alone 
'Cause we've been makin' plans of our own

Skullduggery, skullduggery
Skullguggery, skullduggery

Had your fun, now your work is done, you've just been usin' me
All the while, had a big bad smile but not quite like your fee
You've been a jerk for what it's worth; a friend is what I need
Now I know that you're the fool and I am finally free

Skullduggery, skullduggery
Skullguggery, skullduggery
