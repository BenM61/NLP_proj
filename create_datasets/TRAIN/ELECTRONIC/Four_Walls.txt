You walked in and said, "I've got some news
I didn't say all I wanted to
You know I told you that I wasn't scared. Well, I lied."
You told me, "Babe I only think of you."
And I said, "All I've got is a bunch of sad stories."
And I told them all before the night was through
And we cried, oh, but we're here now
And I'm trying hard to make you love me but I don't wanna try too hard
And I'm trying hard to take it lightly but we're here now

Those four walls now are the only place that I can breathe out
And those four walls now are home
Those four walls now are the only place that I can feel
Those four walls now are home

I wanna make you feel how I feel when I'm listening to love songs
I wanna take you to the peak of everything that you are
You're everything I need tonight
And I'm trying hard to make you want me
But I don't wanna try too hard
I was thinking you got what you came for
But you're here now

Those four walls now are the only place that I can breathe out
Those four walls now are home
Those four walls now are the only place that I can feel
Those four walls now are home

Falling at the hand of a perfect man
Falling at the hand of a perfect man

Those four walls now are the only place that I can breathe out
Those four walls now are home
Those three words now are the only thing that came to save me
Those three words now are home

Falling at the hand of a perfect man
