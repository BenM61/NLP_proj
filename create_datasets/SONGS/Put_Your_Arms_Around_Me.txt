How am I supposed to wait when the nights last forever?
When am I supposed to stop missing you when I know I'll never?
Times moving slowly, I'm standing still.
Come back and say that you will

Put your arms around me 
Your the one and only 
I'll be there if you let your heart show you the way
Come lay down beside me 
Put your arms around me 
I'll be there when the dawn meets the day 

You tell me not to count the days 
And I don't I'm down to hours 
No matter what you tell me over the phone 
I want to see it in your eyes, in your eyes 
Can't put my arms around a photograph
Love from a distance won't last

Put your arms around me 
Your the one and only 
I'll be there if you let your heart show you the way
Come lay down beside me 
Put your arms around me 
I'll be there when the dawn meets the day 

Only you can revive me 
And save me from a broken heart 
I want to have you beside me 
Together make a brand new start 

Put your arms around me 
Your the one and only 
I'll be there if you let your heart show you the way
Come lay down beside me 
Put your arms around me 
I'll be there when the dawn meets the day
