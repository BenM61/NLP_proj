Is this what you want
Every finger points at me
This might be funny
If it wasn't such a tragedy
After a while
It gets harder to smile
And pretend that things are OK

So when you need me in the middle of the night
I won't be there 'cause you're always breaking my heart
You're always breaking my heart
you always tear it apart
Yeah oh yeah

So cross yourself now
Get down on your knees and pray
But no powers from heaven
Could ever take the darkness away

I've tried climbing your walls (ah ah ah)
But you've built them too tall (ah ah ah)
So it's time I walk away now (walk away now)

And when you call me in the middle of the night (of the night)
There's no one there 'cause you're always breaking my heart
You're always breaking my heart
You always tear it apart
Yeah yeah yeah

Reach out a hand to hold (ah ah ah)
Ain't it sad when the distance grows (ah)
Two hearts cling to their fates
Remember that first embrace
But I can't worry anymore

So when you need me in the middle of the night
(of the night)
I won't be there 'cause you're always breaking my heart
You're always breaking my heart
You always tear it apart
Oh yeah
You're always breaking my heart
You're always breaking my heart
You always tear it apart
Yeah yeah yeah
