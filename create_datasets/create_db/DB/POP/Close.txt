Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn
I'm so perplexed
With just one breath, I'm locked in
Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn
I'm so perplexed
On that, it's almost shocking
I know, I know you know you're scared
Your heart, your mind, your soul, your body
They won't, they won't, they won't be careful
But I guess that you don't know me

'Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
'Cause space is just a word made up by someone who's afraid to get too

Close, oh
Oh, so close, oh
I want you close, ooh
'Cause space is just a word made up by someone who's afraid to get close, oh
Oh, so close, oh
I want you close, ooh
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no

Oh man, oh man
I am not really known for ever being speechless
But now, but now somehow
My words roll off my tongue right onto your lips, oh
I'm keeping cool while you keep smiling
Saying all the things I'm thinking
Oh man, oh man
I am like you so I want proof of what you're feeling

'Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
'Cause space is just a word made up by someone who's afraid to get too

Close, oh
Oh, so close, oh
I want you close, oh (yeah baby)
'Cause space was just a word made up by someone who's afraid to get close, oh
Oh, so close, ooh
I want you close, ooh
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no

'Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
'Cause space was just a word made up by someone who's afraid to get too 

Close
Close, oh (close baby)
Oh, so close, oh
I want you close, oh (baby)
'Cause space was just a word made up by someone who's afraid to get close, oh
Oh, so close, oh
I want you close, oh
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no
Yeah baby (close oh)
Tell me baby what you want
(Close, oh)
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no
