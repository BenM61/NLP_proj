Rock'n'Roll is all I want to do
Rock'n'Roll is all I want to do
Rock'n'Roll is all I want to do
Rock'n'Roll is all I want from you

Rain keeps falling down
I'll leave this northern town
I'll run from your mentality
And leave you all behind you'll see
There's no more giving up
And no more giving in to you
Cause I have dreams to realize
It's burning in my heart you'll see

Rock'n'Roll is all I want to do
Rock'n'Roll is all I want to do
Rock'n'Roll is all I want to do
Rock'n'Roll is all I want from you

No more shattered dreams
For what I could have been
I'll escape reality
And shape my destiny you'll see
It's my turn to shine
To set the world alight
What will be will always be
It's burning in my heart you'll see

Rock'n'Roll is all I want to do
Rock'n'Roll is all I want to do
Rock'n'Roll is all I want to do
Rock'n'Roll is all I want from you
