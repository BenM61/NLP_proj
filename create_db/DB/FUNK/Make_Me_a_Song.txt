I'm on a mission
Sun is out, my skin is glistenin'
Got my jeans on, tank top chillin'
With my girlfriends looking fabulous

My tan is just amazin'
Turn it up that song is blazin'
Call me, I'm headed to L.A. and
Gotta make sure I ask Timbaland

Can you give a song like
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat?

Can you give me a song
That you and missy wrote
Missy wrote
Missy wrote?

Somethin' like get you're freak on
'Cause kiley needs something to sing on
Make me something I can get my groove on
Somethin' I can get my groove on

3 o'clock at the studio
Timbaland is playin' [incomprehensible], kinda low
Feel the love in the room soon as I hit the door
Bubba's pacin' around gettin' ready to flow

Tim is in the corner doin' a track
Bobbin' his head, I know he's feelin' that
Take his headphones off and he looks my way
And he asks me what I wanna do and I say

Can you give a song like
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat?

Can you give me a song
That you and missy wrote

Somethin' I can get my groove on

And then he asked if I liked this
Or do you like this?
Or do you like this?
And then he flipped it

And then we start to move
We're gettin' in the groove
He says it's just for you
And I'm glad I asked

Can you give a song like
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat?

Can you give me a song

I think I got somethin' for you
Oh, I think I got somethin' for you
Oh, I think I got somethin' for you
