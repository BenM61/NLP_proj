I've been young
I've been old
I've been hurt
And consoled
Heart of coal
Heart of gold
So I'm told

I've been lost
I've been found
I've been taken
By the sound
Of my own voice
The voices in my head

I can't help it if I fall in
Love with you again I'm calling
Just to let you know
It dawned on me

Every night is a test
To the east from the west
The sun rises and sets
That's the sun at it's best

I forget, then I know
I'd regret letting you go
Sometimes I can't believe how dark it can be

But I can't help it if I fall in
Love with you again I'm calling
Just to let you know
It dawned on me
It dawned on me

So on
And so forth
And again
I will stop to begin
At the end

I can't help it if I fall in
Love with you again I'm calling
Just to let you know
It dawned on me

Oh I can't help it if I fall in
Love with you again I'm calling
Just to let you know
It dawned on me
