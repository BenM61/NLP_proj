It just depends how close to ground level you are
It just depends how close to ground level you are
Can you see the hurt? Can you see the pain?
Can you feel the rain comin' like a train of thought?
It just depends how close to ground level you are

Whether rain or shine, whether yours or mine
Say I won't go blind for no Philistine no more
It just depends how close to ground level you are
So get on a train of thought, so get on a train of thought

We're sick of seein' poverty
We're sick of seein' misery
We're sick of the fatality
In every locality

Are we just killing time, waiting for a sign
Like a battle cry or a long goodbye? No, no
It just depends how close to ground level you are
So get on a train of thought
It just depends how close to ground level you are

They'll use you as artillery
They want you in the military
You've gotta know your enemy
But we all know who the killer be
They act so viciously

Wearin' pure disguise, they camouflage their eyes
All around there's spies, no one realize, no, no
It just depends how close to ground level you are
So get on a train of thought, so get on a train of thought

We're sick of seein' poverty
We're sick of seein' poverty
We're sick of seein' poverty

Are we just killing time, waiting for a sign
Like a battle cry or a long goodbye? No, no
It just depends how close to ground level you are
Get on a train of thought
