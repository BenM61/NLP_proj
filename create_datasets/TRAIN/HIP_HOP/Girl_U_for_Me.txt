Just ask and I'll do, I'll do it for you.
There'll be no more games that we'll play.
 
Tonight is the night and the moon is right, 
Baby, let me tell you, I'm in love with you tonight.
The more love we make and the more love we take,
Let me tell you, I won't let you get away.
 
Girl U for me, and girl me for U.
I don't care what people might say.
Just ask and I'll do, I'll do it for you.
There'll be no more games that we'll play.
 
The night that we met is the night I won't forget,
How you touched my heart and you made me realize.
I knew you were the one after all was said and done,
Baby, can I tell you, that I want you by my side.
 
Girl U for me, and girl me for U.
I don't care what people might say.
Just ask and I'll do, I'll do it for you.
There'll be no more games that we'll play.
 
Some thing real freaky now baby 
I wanna see you come on.
I wanna see who can make who scream first
Can you make me scream, can you make me scream
I don't want to just make love
Let me tell you what I'm talking about baby.
 
Girl U for me, and girl me for U.
I don't care what people might say.
Just ask and I'll do, I'll do it for you.
There'll be no more games that we'll play.
 
Girl U for me, and girl me for U.
I don't care what people might say.
Just ask and I'll do, I'll do it for you.
There'll be no more games that we'll play.
