We're the ones that had to sail the course
The course of friendship and trust, of course
Always heading for the eye of the storm
Getting stuck in one way, shape or form

Like an army we followed your lead
We cried with you and we watched you bleed
Loyalty at its ultimate
We paid our dues and this is what we get?

There was a time when we were family
We looked after you, and you looked after we
We flew your flag and defended it
But like a blind man you just ignored it

Through heavy rain
Through all the pain
Through heavy winds
Through all our sins
We hold her steady!
We hold her steady!
We hold her steady!

Steady as she goes

We've stood our time, and only time will tell
For awhile you had us under a spell
Now it's broken, and you can go to hell
We're tired of you pissing in our wishing well

Friendship comes and friendship goes
Where it stops nobody knows
