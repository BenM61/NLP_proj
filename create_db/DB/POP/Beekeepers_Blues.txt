You only call when you want money
And when I need you you're not there
Everybody else has written you right off
You make it hard to care
You're pretty hard to bear

Women think that you're a genius
'Til you get caught for who you are
I reeled you in and you ate me half alive
You were a future star
Who do you think you are?

No good deed will go unpunished, oh oh oh
And no beekeeper goes unstung
And these boots are made for walkin'
They're walking back to you
What else can I do?

I know you know that you're good lookin'
And you're not known for too much else
I took you in and you left me half a live
Don't know what you do
Or who you do it to

When I'm gone someone will save you
When she gets tired there's always someone new
I reeled you in and you ate me half alive
You were a future star
Who do you think you are?

Who do you think you are?
I reeled you in and you ate me half alive
You were a future star
Who do you think you are?

No good deed will go unpunished, yea yea yea
No beekeeper goes unstung
And these boots are made for walkin'
I'm walkin' back to you
What else can I do?

Oh no no (oh no no)
Walkin' back to you (walkin' back to you)
Oh oh oh, walkin' back to you (walkin' back to you)
(I'd do it all again, I'd do it all again) with you
