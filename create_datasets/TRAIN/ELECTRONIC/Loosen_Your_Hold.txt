Feed me something
We'll go back to the start
Take pride of place
Understand our reasons
A photograph taken at the time when
Confidence won't up and leave

So loosen you hold
Though your might be frightened
Release or be caught
If this be the right thing
Unable by thought
To look what the tide brings in
