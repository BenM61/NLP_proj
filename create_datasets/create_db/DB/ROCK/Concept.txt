She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the status quo
Oh yeah oh yeah 

Still she won't be forced against her will
Says she don't do drugs but she does the pill
Oh yeah oh yeah 

I didn't want to hurt you oh yeah 
I didn't want to hurt you oh yeah 

Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh yeah oh yeah 

When she's at the gig she takes her car
And she drive us home if it is in a bar
Oh yeah oh yeah 

I didn't want to hurt you oh yeah 
I didn't want to hurt you oh yeah 

I didn't want to hurt you oh yeah
I didn't want to hurt you oh yeah
