Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do

I hear them whispering when I walk by
He's gonna break her heart and make her cry
I know it's me they're talking about
I bet they all think I'll never find out

Ohhh but Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue but what can I do

My friends are telling me that he's no good
He isn't treating me the way he should
He really loves me that's all I can say
Before my tears fall I just walk away

Ohh but Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do
Ohhhh

Deep down inside he loves me
Though he may run around
Deep down inside he loves me
Some day he'll settle down

Ohhh Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do

He really loves me that's all I can say
Before my tears fall I just walk away

Ohh but Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do

Ohh but Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do
