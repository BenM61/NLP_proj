Big beat keeps you rockin' in your seat,
Big beat keeps you rockin' in your seat,
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
You got to move when you hear this beat
Big beat keeps you rockin' in your seat

Big beay keeps you rockin' in your seat,
Ol' grandpa just make it eighty years old
Maim and scream, puff and rock'n roll.
The big beat get in your soul
Make you jump, and make you roll.
Ol' grandpa just make it 80 years old.

Peg-leg Joe just throw his crutches away.
Big beat makes you act this way.
C'mon gang lets swing the swing
The big beat makes you act this queer
Peg-leg Joe just throw his crutches away.

Big beat keeps you rockin' in your seat,
Big beat keeps you rockin' in your seat,
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
You got to move when you hear this beat
Big beat keeps you rockin' in your seat
