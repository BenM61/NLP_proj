We're not indestructible,
Baby better get that straight
I think it's unbelievable
How you give into the hands of fate

Some things are worth fighting for some
Feelings never die
I'm not askin' for another chance
I just want to know why

There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out givin' in can't be wrong

I don't want to pasify you
I don't want to drag you down
But I'm feelin like a prisoner
Like a stranger in a no named town

I see all the angry faces
Afraid that could be you and me
Talkin about what might have been
I'm thinkin about what I used to be

There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home
Ther's no easy way out givin' in can't be wrong

Baby,baby we can shed this skin
We can know how we feel inside
Instead of goin' down and endless road
Not knowin if we're dead or alive

Some things are worth fightin for
Some feelings never die
I'm not askin for another chance
I just want to know why

There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out givin in givin in can't be wrong no
There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home
There's no easy no easy no easy way out

There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out givin in givin in can't be wrong no
There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home
There's no easy no easy no easy way out
