Yes it sho look good but it... don't mean a thang to me
I've got a cool shakin' baby... shake like a wildwood tree

You went away baby... you got back a little too late
You went away baby... you got back a little too late
I've got a cool shakin' baby... shake like jello on a plate

When my baby walks... you know she's fightin' below
Yeah when my baby walks... you know she's fightin' below

Yes and when she stops... (her) flesh, it shakes like jello

Well now shake little baby

Shake like a wild wood tree

Now let it shake... now let it shake

Let it shake a little baby
Shake like a wild wood tree
