Oh there's somethin' bout the skylight tonight
Something that makes me know everything's goin' be alright
There's somethin' in the way that the stars align
There's not a single moment I'ma pass by

The hour's now
The base is loud
The disco lights
Shinin' through the crowd
We're holdin' time in our hands and it stops when we say
We say
And we ain't stoppin' 'til the morning light

We gotta hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stoppin' for no one
The night is young
Don't let them turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done
When we break the dawn

We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn

Oh there somethin' on the surface right now
Somethin' the keeps me movin' diggin' deeper down
So I just let the speakers speak to me
Vibrations movin' on the floor all around

The hour's now (yes)
The base is loud (yes)
The disco lights (yes)
Shinin' through the crowd
We're holdin' time in our hands and it stops when we say
And we ain't stopping 'til the morning light

We gotta hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stoppin' for no one
The night is young
Don't let them turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done
When we break the dawn

We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn

The daylight scene never hurt nobody
And if the DJ decides there ain't no more party
Cause we're turnin' when we're good and ready
We step outside
Til the sunrise
Wait up and let me

We ain't goin' nowhere
Til we good and ready
Oh
Break the dawn!

We gotta hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stoppin' for no one
The night is young
Don't let them turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done
When we break the dawn

We gotta hold back the sun

We break the dawn
