From the Album:
* Lovesweat

Blue for the blue - I feel when I'm feelin' down
On the ground - feelin' down that could be most anyday
Green for the eyes - take a look around
When the sun goes down - and the sun goes down
In the strangest way -
Red for the light - gotta stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say - meant to say -
Pray for the mice that are blind like the world
Never see the good that is done to the bad
It's too late to see
Two of us make it easier, to read the signs
Memorize the lines - you play with me
One for the road - I'll be on my way
Come another day - when the things we say
Find a way to be - way to be -
Solo:
Autumn calls for a change of year
Bringin' winter near us - greens are brown
And disquise a sign -
Wintertime is a razorblade - that the devil made
It's a price we pay for the summertime
Springdays come it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from - where the children go -
It's a nursery rhyme - nursery rhyme
