Bop 'til you drop
In the hot city
Keep on workin' day and night
Don't stop 'til you get what you want
Bop 'til you drop
'Til you're sick with it
Burn the candle burn it bright
Love won't
Love won't wait

You wake up wired
And draw on your make-up
And the city breathes
And the city comes to life
Lately it seems
Your time is all used up
Chasin' dreams
Of money and the good life

But there is somethin'
You're thinkin' of
Lately you're feelin'
The power of love
Everybody says it's
So hard to hold
The alarm rings
You gotta get up
You gotta get up

Bop 'til you drop
In the hot city
Keep on workin' day and night
Don't stop 'til you get what you want
Bop 'til you drop
'Til you're sick with it
Burn the candle burn it bright
Love won't
Love won't wait
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

You say you're the lucky one
But you don't believe it
And you want to stop
And you want to take some time
To source out a feeling
And look for a reason
And the flesh is weak
But the spirit is willing

Cause there is somethin'
You've been thinkin' of
Lately you're feelin'
The power of love
Everybody says it's so
So hard to hold
The alarm rings
You gotta get up
You gotta get up

Bop 'til you drop
In the hot city
Keep on workin' day and night
Don't stop 'til you get what you want
Bop 'til you drop
'Til you're sick with it
Burn the candle burn it bright
Love won't
Love won't wait
