Oh
Oh ooh

Hey, whoa baby 
(not such an innocent girl)

First impressions can be wrong
So let me clear what's goin' on
Baby I'm not who you think I am
I need to feel some lips on mine
So I'm pullin' you across the line
You think I'm the fragile one
One slip the damage done

I'm not made of china
I'm not made of glass
Would it shatter your illusions 
If this angel had a past?

If you touch me I won't break
Don't think of me that way
I'm not such an innocent girl
Don't wrap me up in cotton-wool
Up on a pedestal
I'm not such an innocent girl

I've got a secret rose tattoo 
I'm dying just to show you
I'm not as shy as you think I am
It's time to take of those kid-gloves
T.K.O. me fall in love
Don't be scared you'll break my heart
I'm not gonna fall apart

I'm not made of china
I'm not made of glass
Would it shatter your illusions 
If this angel had a past?

If you touch me I won't break
Don't think of me that way
I'm not such an innocent girl
Don't wrap me up in cotton-wool
Up on a pedestal
I'm not such an innocent girl

If you touch, if you touch me, I
If you touch me I won't break
If you touch, if you touch me, I
If you touch me I won't

Not such an innocent girl

(Ooh no I won't break)

If you touch me I won't break
Don't think of me that way
I'm not such an innocent girl
Don't wrap me up (come on) in cotton-wool (who)
Up on a pedestal
I'm not such an innocent girl 
(dying just to show you)

If you touch me I won't break
I won't break, don't think of me that way 
(no, no)
Not such an innocent girl, whoa
I'm not such an innocent girl

If you touch me I won't break
Don't think of me that way
I'm not such an innocent girl
Don't wrap me up in cotton-wool
Up on a pedestal
I'm not such an innocent girl

If you touch, my world won't fall apart
No you won't break my heart
