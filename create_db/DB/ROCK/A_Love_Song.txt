I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home

There's a wren in a willow wood
Flies so high and sings so good
He brings to you what he sings to you
And love in his lullaby, sing to tell me if I try
I can fly for you, look around, I'm gonna try for you, girl

I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long, yeah
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home

Oh, I wanna sing you a love song, yeah
Wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home

Ooh, la la la la
Don't you know I've always loved you?
Heaven knows I love you
