Now I'm sliding
It's intriguing
So young yet
Too old to learn

That summer is the thirst
The river always runs dry first

You're in heaven
This is heaven now
You're in heaven

You're in heaven
This is heaven now
You're in heaven

As the tides they
Draw and close
And the seasons
Turn again

Will the moon still
Wax and wane?
Will you always
Color the day?

You're in heaven
This is heaven now
You're in heaven

You're in heaven
This is heaven now
You're in heaven

Now I'm sliding
It's intriguing
This is heaven now)
So young yet
Too old to learn

That summer is the thirst
The river always runs dry first

You're in heaven
This is heaven now
You're in heaven

You're in heaven
This is heaven now
You're in heaven

You're in heaven
This is heaven now
You're in heaven

You're in heaven
This is heaven now
You're in heaven

You're in heaven
This is heaven now
You're in heaven
