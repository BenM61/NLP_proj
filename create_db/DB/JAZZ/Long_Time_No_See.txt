Long time no see,
Baby, what's the reason I get the go by
Like to know why long time no see
Long time adore
If you're on the level why don't you tell me
Why me no see you any more
Let him go, let him go
Everyone keeps tellin' me
But my heart can no agree
Guess my heart knows best
And the rest is up to you
Honestly, am I just a fool for stringin' along
Oh baby what's wrong
Long time no see

Long time no see
Baby, what's the reason I get the go by
Like to know why long time no see
Long time oh I adore
If you're on the level why don't you tell me
Why me no see you any more, more, more
Let him go, let him go, let him go, let him go
Everyone keeps tellin' me
But my heart can no agree
Ra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You, me no see, what can it be
Maybe I'm crazy, but long time no see

Ra-ra-ra long time no see
What's the reason I get the go by
Like to know why long time no see
Me love you, you love who
Is it yes or is it no
Do I stay or do I go
I'd be in a stew if you ever said we're through
What to do
If you loved me the way that I love you
It wouldn't be, it wouldn't be
Long time no see
It could be true that I love you
I miss you so, long time no see
