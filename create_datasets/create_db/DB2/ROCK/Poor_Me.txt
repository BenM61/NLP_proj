Poor me wa a ha a ho
Poor me wa a ha a ho
Sorry thoughts leaping around my head
It's been heard and it's been said
That
You tried to date another guy
Didn't hide, didn't even try
Cheating me with lies again
Making me remember when

I used to hold you baby
So tight, each night, that's right
I kinda hoped that maybe you might
Fall for me

Why oh why do voices say to me
Sit and cry, that this was meant to be
Loves unkind and loves untrue
Oh why did love pick out you
For me, for me
Wa ha poor me
Poor me

I used to hold you baby
So tight, each night, that's right
I kinda hoped that maybe you might
Fall for me

Why oh why do voices say to me
Sit and cry, that this was meant to be
Loves unkind and loves untrue
Oh why did love pick out you
For me, for me
Wa ha poor me
Poor me
