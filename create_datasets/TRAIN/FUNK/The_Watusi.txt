Wah, wah-a Watusi 
C'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance 
Wah, wah-a Watusi 
Oh, baby, it's the dance made-a for romance (shoo-bop, shoo-bop, ahh) 

Baby, baby, when you do The Twist 
Never, never do you get yourself kissed 
'cause you're always dancin' far apart 
The Watusi, girl, is-a really smart 

Wah-a, wah, wah-a Watusi 
C'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance (shoo-bop, shoo-bop, ahh) 

Baby, baby, when you do The Fly 
Your arms are wasted wavin' in the sky 
Come on and hold me like a lover should 
The Watusi makes you feel so good 

Wah-a, wah, wah-a Watusi 
Oh, baby, it's the dance made-a for romance 
Yay!! 

(shoo-bop, shoo-bop, ahh) 

Baby, baby, that's the way it goes 
Nothing happens when you Mash Potatoes 
I just gotta fall in love with you 
Watusi is the dance to do 

Wah-a, wah, wah-a Watusi 
C'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance 

Wah, wah-a Watusi 
FADE 
Oh, baby, it's the dance made-a for romance
