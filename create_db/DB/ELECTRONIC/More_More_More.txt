Ooh, how do you like your love
Ooh, how do you like your love

But if you want to know
How I really feel
Just get the cameras rolling
Get the action going
Baby you know my love for you is real
Take me where you want to
Then my heart you'll steal

More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it

Ooh, how do you like your love
Ooh, how do you like your love

And if you want to know
What it means to me
Just hear the rhythm grooving
Get your body moving
Baby you know my love for you is true
Any time you want to
Do what you gotta do

More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like your love

Baby you know my love for you is real
Take me where you want to
Then my heart you steal

More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like your love
