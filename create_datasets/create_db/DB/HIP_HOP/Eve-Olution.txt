[Verse 1]
Now I ain't ever been the type to
Not excite ya
Can't miss the vixen that meant ya like her
Play ya position, just might invite ya
Party till the mornin if she like ya
I ain't attracted to no lame dudes,
Don't want to name a few
Don't lie either so don't ask
She might be namin you
When I'm allergic to these corny bitches
Tryna start shit to end my ? I'm too up on my riches
?Gang? been a part of me, dawg, and I'm'ma keep winnin
Never shoulda started me off
I love the way I'm livin
And they wonder why she won't stop
Sit around mumblin to myself hopin that my shit flop
Now that's the shit I like to laugh at
Obsessed with my every move
Dummy, find a crash test
Every year I'm just a little wiser
And yo it's still gon be left in the race ?
[Chorus]
(Ayyo she got it like)
(E!)
Every day, eatin and takin it to the
(V!)
Vixen V-12 with systems
(E!)
Everybody keepin it movin
It's double are, ???, this is Eve-olution, now scream
(E!)
If you're really ready we're takin it to the
(V!)
Vicious spit flows ridiculous
(E!)
Say it like you know the letters
Bombshell ???? scream my name for me
(There's more but I have no more time to sit here and type out lyrics for you
