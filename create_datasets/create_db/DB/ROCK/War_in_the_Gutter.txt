Warriors of the street
want to beat their enemies
The shark's broke the truce
Tonight's the night, who'll win who'll lose
This is not your turf
Unarmed you just die first
Ruthless they fight their fight
To defend their walls feeds their pride

Senseless massacre tonight
Kid kills kid in this riot
The rulers don't want to care
Deaf and blind hiding in their lair
War in the gutter, hoy!

Watch out!

Angel shotgun
You have to fight or run
The leads tight tonight
Who knows who's wrong, who's right
Shining blade, a yell
Running blood, a lad fell
He's so surprised
He dies in a gutter another wasted life

Senseless massacre tonight
Kid kills kid in this riot
The rulers don't want to care
Deaf and blind hiding in their lair
War in the gutter, hoy!
