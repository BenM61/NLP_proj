Hum diddy hum diddy hum diddy doo 
I got a special kind of lovin' 
And it's just for you 
Come and get it

Come and get it what'cha gonna do 
I ain't got all day to wait on you
Yippie-yi yippie-yi yippie yi-yay 
I can't seem to find the right words to say 

They are few but they all are true 
But I ain't got all time to wait on you 
Yippie-yi, yippie-yi what's it gonna be 
I believe since I saw you

That you were made for me 
Don't be late don't offer a date 
I do believe we make a perfect mate 
Leroy Detroit and old 102 

They ain't got enough of good lovin' for you 
They ain't where it is
Baby this is where it's at 
So come and get your lovin'

From your lovin' boy Fats
