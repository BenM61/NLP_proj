I got a one track mind, my blinder's up
Now all I gotta do is get up, go out and get her
Got the first step down, I know what I want
All seven senses tryin' to deliver

Now baby, let me fill you up inside (Up inside)
Spread your wings and open wide (Open wide)
So hot, so hot, so hot

I'm a man on a mission, straight ahead
Less talk, more action with no distractions
I am all conditioned, thoroughbred
Go for the action with no distractions, yeah

You give every inch, flesh, blood and bone
And it's all wrapped up in a tight little bundle
Got an open mind, do anything
I've been aware the ball might roll or tumble

So, right down to the bottom of the top (uh uh uh)
I'm gonna do it all in one big pot
Yeah, she got, she got me hot, uh

I'm a man on a mission, straight ahead
Less talk, more action with no distractions
I'm all conditioned, I'm a thoroughbred
Less talk, more action with no distractions

Ow, yeah, uh
I got no distractions
So get on, outta my way

Only thing that's on my mind
Ah, she sure got my attention
Once you taste the real kind
Oh

Uh, ah, come on
She got, she got, ah
Man on a mission, straight ahead
No talk, no action, I got no distractions

I'm all conditioned, what I say
A man on a mission, up ahead
Ah yeah, woo, my kinda action
Ow, uh

No distractions, I got no distractions

No distractions, I'm on a mission, woo, ow
