Didn't go nowhere, never left uh
You really thought that I was
Gone (gone gone gone)
I heard you talking like I lost my swagger
Said I was over you were
Wrong (wrong wrong wrong)

I'm always improving
Always on the move and
Working on my flow
To take it to the studio
This is not a comeback
Following my own path
Laying down the fat tracks
Still a music maniac

Whoa
Well I know that I'll make it
Never put my head down
T-t-turn it up loud
Yeah
'Cause I don't have to fake it
If I keep on working it
A billion hits is what I'll get

Whoa
That's what I'm gonna get
Whoa
That's what I'm gonna get

Yeah
'Cause I know that I'll make it
Overload the internet
A billion hits is what I'll get

A billion hits is what I'll get

Now you can't breathe
Why so quiet
No you don't believe your
Eyes (eyes eyes eyes)
You pushed me till' I had to
Start this riot, now I'll never be
Denied ('nied 'nied 'nied)

I'm always improving
Always on the move and
Working on my flow
Till' ya hear me on the radio
I know I can be a star
Take off like a rocket car
Everyday I'm working hard
To get my name on every chart

Whoa
Well I know that I'll make it
Never put my head down
T-t-turn it up loud
Yeah
'Cause I don't have to fake it
If I keep on working it
A billion hits is what I'll get

Whoa
That's what I'm gonna get
Whoa
That's what I'm gonna get

Yeah
'Cause I know that I'll make it
Overload the internet
A billion hits is what I'll get

Call someone
I think this is an emergency
Hey
Pull the plug
Austin's blowing up my p.c.
Every hour day and night
Can't get this rocker out my site

You can't get me outta your site
You can't get me outta your site
You thought that I was gone
Guess that you were wrong
'Cause I just wrote your new favorite song

Whoa
Well I know that I'll make it
Never put my head down
T-t-turn it up loud
Yeah
'Cause I don't have to fake it
If I keep on working it
A billion hits is what I'll get

Whoa
That's what I'm gonna get
Whoa
That's what I'm gonna get

Yeah
'Cause I know that I'll make it
Overload the internet
A billion hits is what I'll get
