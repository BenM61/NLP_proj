Hello and welcome to my room
There's no easy way out
We can sail on the rain on my yellow umbrella 
Stay back
And hold your breath away, all the clouds are in bed
We can feed my guitars anytime in the morning
In the morning in the rainbow
Uuh!

Hello and welcome to my room, there's no easy way out
Would you show me the way into the master antenna?
In the mountains, in the rainbow

You are one of a kind
You are one of a kind 
You are the one of mine
The only the one in my life 

You are the one of a kind
You are the one of a kind the only one I want
Everyday of my life

Breathe out and take your helmet off 
There's no war in my room
We can lay on the grass have a laugh every morning
In the morning, in the rainbow

You are the one of a kind
You are the one of a kind
You are one of mine
The only one in my life

You are the one of a kind
You are the one of a kind
You are the one I want
Everyday of my life
