No more,
It's done,
Crawl home,
Get gone,
Your love,
Is evil,
Lonesome,
My bones

[Chorus]
Took me such a long time to figure it out,
Now is it too late, I can't do without,
Took me such a long time to figure it out,
Don't take it away, away, oh

Snowstorm,
My heart,
Crawl home,
Your love,
Is evil,
And lonesome,
Just get more,
When you've dared

[Chorus: x2]
