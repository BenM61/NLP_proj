Caught in quicksand and I'm startin' to sink
So tired of strugglin' that my mind can barely think
I don't know where I'm goin'
Lord, I don't know what I'm gonna do

My fuel supply is finished, there ain't nothing left to burn
I need someone to help me but I don't know which way to turn
I know I don't have much of a choice
I?ll go out of my mind or into the night

I'm rollin' and tumblin', spinnin' end over end
Got to have some peace and quiet so I can find myself again
Still if you ask me what's the matter
I just don't know what to say

There's people all around me but I feel so alone
I guess they'd like to help me but I have to do it on my own
I know I don't have much of a choice
I?ll go out of my mind or into the night, into the night

I'm rollin' and tumblin', spinnin' end over end
Got to have some peace and quiet so I can find myself again
Still if you ask me what's the matter
I just don't know what to say

There's people all around me but I feel so alone
I guess they'd like to help me but I have to do it on my own
I know I don't have much of a choice
I?ll go out of my mind or into the night, into the night, into the night
