Free Love
Don't be a slave to your passion
(Talkin' bout) Free Love
Ya might get a negative reaction

A child is born
And my love is gone
Where in the world is he
Now's the time I need him to be

By my side
To ease the pressure
That's on my mind

He enjoyed the happiness
But forgot about all the rest
Of his responsibility
Oh, that's what I get for

Free Love
Don't be a slave to your passion
(Talkin' bout) Free Love
Ya might get a negative reaction

Experience again
Proves to be the best teacher
Oh, strong get stronger (uh huh)
And the weak get weaker

Im tryin to tell ya that its no good
To let your heart
Control all the moves you make

Cause theres a difference between right and wrong
Being loved and strung along
Ill know better
Ill know better the next time

Free Love
Dont be a slave to your passion
(Talkin bout) Free Love
Ya might get a negative reaction

You gotta take it from me, listen to me
Dont go round givin ya love to just anyone
Dont go round givim ya love to just anyone
Find somebody who loves ya not just for your body
Find somebody who loves ya not just for your body

Free Love
Don't be a slave to your passion

I'm tryin to tell ya that it's no good
To give yourself
To just anyone

Because I thought I was having fun
Now I'm the lonely one
I'll know better
I'll know better the next time

Free Love
Don't be a slave to your passion
(Talkin' bout) Free Love
Ya might get a negative reaction

You gotta take it from me, listen to me
Don't go 'round givin' ya love to just anyone
Don't go 'round givi' ya love to just anyone
Find somebody who loves ya not just for your body
Find somebody who loves ya not just for your body
