High, high energy
High, high energy

You make me feel light as a breeze
Flying like an eagle, touching life with ease
See the glow you excite within me
Ooh, the love is bursting, bursting in me

High, high energy
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
High, high energy

Every time you love you love me
The way I like it, yeah
Every time it's something different
I wouldn't share you if I could

You make me feel light as a breeze
Flying like an eagle, touching life with ease
See the glow you excite within me
Ooh, the love is bursting, bursting in me

High, high energy
High, high energy

You make me feel light as a breeze
Flying like an eagle, touching life with ease
See the glow you excite within me
Ooh, the love is bursting, bursting in me

High, high energy
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
High, high energy
High, high energy
