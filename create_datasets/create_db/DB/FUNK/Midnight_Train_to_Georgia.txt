L.A. proved too much for the man
(He couldn't make it)
So he's leavin' the life he's come to know
(He said he's goin')
He said he's goin' back to find
Ooh, what's left of his world
The world he left behind
Not so long ago

He's leavin'
On that midnight train to Georgia
Said he's goin' back
To a simpler place in time

And I'll be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine

He kept dreamin'
That someday he'd be a star
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true
So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold his old car
Bought a one way ticket back
To the life he once knew
Oh yes he did
He said he would

He's leavin'
On that midnight train to Georgia
Said he's goin' back to find
A simpler place in time

And I'm gonna be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than be without him in mine

He's leavin'
On that midnight train to Georgia
Said he's goin' back to find
A simpler place in time

And I've gotta be with him
On the midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than be without him in mine

Go, gonna board, gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
Gonna board the midnight train
Gotta go, gonna board
Gonna board
Gonna board the midnight train
