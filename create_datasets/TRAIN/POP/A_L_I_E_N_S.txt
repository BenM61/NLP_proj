We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History someone to know
We were moving at the speed of flight

Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

Just an alien

We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line
 
Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
All a lifetime

Just an alien (moving target)
Target movement
Oh, we just want to get home again
Of the space time
Turning forward
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again
