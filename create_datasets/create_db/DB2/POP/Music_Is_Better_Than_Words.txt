When you get all set 
To go into your big love scene
The night must be right
The mood be slow
The wine must be high
And the lights must be low

And I recommend some music in the background
For when you're fumbling for the right words to say
You'll find that music will go a long way

Music is better than words
You break the spell when you start to speak
That technique is all wrong
Just forget about words and sing her a song

Music was made for romance
Love and a sweet song go hand in glove 
Every lover knows this
And the sweeter the song, the sweeter the kiss

When you're without love you cry
And your song is the blues
But when you've got love you're high
And your song is a gay refrain
A happy strain that sings out the news
Don't let the night go to waste
Looking for ways to say 'I love you'
Take your cue from the birds
Music is better than words

Don't let the night go to waste
Looking for ways to say 'I love you'
Take your cue from the birds
Music is better than words
Music is better than words
