Chrome neon Jesus
You are the ghost in that machine
Come to receive us
Don't wait for me

My heart yields a motion chair [?]
This time death has nothing left to give
Have you forgotten what its like?
A phone call from another life
The pay phone is dead but you're still on the line
I guess we're all just killing time

Chrome neon Jesus
You are the ghost in that machine
Come to receive us
Don't wait for me

Your mother [?]
Your electric journey in the light
Forever alone but it's alright
But it's alright

Black out live
Dig up the bones nothing feels complete
I fade out with the morning light
Shake me down a nervous wreck
Your goodbye to me and much like to confess
I guess we're all just killing time

Chrome neon Jesus
You are the ghost in that machine
Come to receive us
Don't wait for me

Your mother [?]
Your electric journey in the light
Forever alone but it's alright
But it's alright
