Oh the lady in red is as fresh as a daisy when the town is in bed
Dancing and dining and shining with originality
She's very proper
She's nothing more than a pal
Oh me and oh my
You'll never stop her
She'll be a dangerous gal 
If she ever met the right guy

Oh the lady in red 
The fellas are crazy for the lady in red
She's a bit gaudy but lord what a pretty personality

Say have you ever met the girl who's the toast of the town
A work of art without a question
You better write her number down, you fools.
