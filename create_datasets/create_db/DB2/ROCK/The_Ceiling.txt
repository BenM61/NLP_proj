Wood burning up on the hill
Seen a drawer full of pills
And it's quiet like snow through the trees
Well I did what I did and I didn't mean anything
Where you come from and where you go
Who you talk to and who you know
And you're lying in fields of green

Well I did what I did and I didn't mean anything
The sun rise, the drive, the morning
The smoke stacks, the bold hats, still learning
And I don't know how I got this far down with the ceiling
And I don't know how I got this far down with the ceiling

Oh, her eyes are wide open right out of her head
Yeah, she's clear of a crown that she cut down for me
Well, I did what I did and I'd do it all over again
I remember everything
Little girl learning to sing because she's crying all over me
But I did what I did and I didn't mean anything

The sun rise, the drive, the morning
The smoke stacks, the bold hats, still learning
And I don't know how I got this far down with the ceiling
And I don't know how I got this far down with the ceiling

Oh, her eyes are wide open right out of her head
Yeah, she's clear of a crown that she cut down for me
Well, I did what I did and I'd do it all over again

We, we should be easy
We should be easy
We should be
We, we should be easy
We should be easy
We should be
We, we should be easy
We should be easy
We should be
We, we should be easy
We should be easy
We should be
We, we should be easy
We should be easy
We should be
Sometime, oh yeah
A little bit sometime.
