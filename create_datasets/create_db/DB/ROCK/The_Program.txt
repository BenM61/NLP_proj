So here we are
Taking everything as it comes
Making plans
And making flaws
From what you see
Numbing thing that
Will make you dream
When nothing around you is real

Ever get the feeling you're losing control
You make mistakes that enhance 
The taste of you lows
And there's not that much
That you know
Ever get the feeling you're losing control
Your thoughts are spaced
And there's not that much
That you know

Then your back again
In the thick of it all
Are you feeling small
From what you've seen
Tell me things
Show me where you've been
I've been here
Just doing my thing

Ever get the feeling you're losing control
You make mistakes that enhance 
The taste of you lows
And there's not that much
That you know
Ever get the feeling you're losing control
Your thoughts are spaced
And there's not that much
That you know

What do you want
Now we've lost all sense of the program
What do you want
Can you tell me something else I don't know

Ever get the feeling you're losing control
You make mistakes that enhance 
The taste of you lows
And there's not that much
That you know
Ever get the feeling you're losing control
Your thoughts are spaced
And there's not that much
That you know
Ever get the feeling you're losing control
You make mistakes that enhance 
The taste of you lows
And there's not that much
That you know
Ever get the feeling you're losing control
Your thoughts are spaced
And there's not that much
That you know
