Since you've been gone
I shut my eyes and I fantasize
That you're here with me
Will you ever return?

I won't be satisfied
'Till you're by my side
Don't wait any longer, come back

Why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?
Please hurry

Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time

You said goodbye
I was trying to hide what I felt inside
Until you passed me by
You said you'd return

You said that you'd be mine
'Till the end of time
Well don't wait any longer

Why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?
Please hurry

Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time

Since you've been gone
Opened my eyes and I realize
What we had together
Will you ever return?

I'll have you change your mind
If you won't stay mine just love me forever
Love me forever

Why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?
Please hurry

Just come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time

Don't ever leave

What if, everything, everything we had together
