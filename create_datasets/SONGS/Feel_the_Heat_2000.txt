Feel the heat of the night 
Everything's alright 
Feel the power of my heart 
Gimme all your love 

Feel the heat of the night 
Everything's alright 
Feel the power of my heart 
Gimme all your love

All you need is feel right now 
All you need is feel right now
All you need is feel right now 
All you need is feel my love

Jumpin', jumpin' up and down 
From the top, right to the ground 
Free your soul and free your mind 
Now set you free, right on time 

It's weekend and it's party time 
Feel the heat and free your mind 
Put your hands up in the air 
And wave 'em like you just don't care 

Feel the rhythm, stay real tight 
Feel the heat, feel the night 
Let the groove control your move 
Shake your bud and make me hot 

Party people, party dance 
Shake your body and wave your hands 
You know how to do it right 
Feel the heat of the night 

Feel the heat of the night 
Everything's alright 
Feel the power of my heart 
Gimme all your love 

Feel the heat of the night 
Everything's alright 
Feel the power of my heart 
Gimme all your love

All you need is feel right now 
All you need is feel right now
All you need is feel right now 
All you need is feel my love

Pumpin', stompin', people jumpin' 
People dancin' everywhere 
The DJ's playing music loud 
So wave your hands up in the air 

Move your body and shake your bud 
The rhythm of the music's so hot 
I see you do your turnaround 
On the dancefloor up and down 

Party, party, people party 
Party, people, party dance 
Come on people, move your body 
Shake your body and wave your hands 

Sweat is droppin' down all over my face 
I feel your sex right in this place 
You gotta get this rhythm right 
And feel the heat of the night

Feel the heat of the night 
Everything's alright 
Feel the power of my heart 
Gimme all your love 

Feel the heat of the night 
Everything's alright 
Feel the power of my heart 
Gimme all your love

All you need is feel right now 
All you need is feel right now
All you need is feel right now 
All you need is feel my love
