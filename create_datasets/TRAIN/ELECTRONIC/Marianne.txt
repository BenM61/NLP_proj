Marianne, oh, Marianne, oh, won't you marry me?
We can have a bamboo hut and brandy in the tea
Leave your fat old mamma home, she never will say yes
If mama don't know now, she can guess  
My, my, yes
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When she walks along the shore, people pause to greet
White birds fly around her; little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love but I'm the only mortal man 
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne 
Don't rush me
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When we marry we will have a time you never saw
I will be so happy I will kiss my mother inlaw
Children by the dozen in and out the bamboo hut 
One for every palm tree and coconut  
Hurry up now
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
