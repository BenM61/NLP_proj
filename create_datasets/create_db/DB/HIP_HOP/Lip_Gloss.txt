Mac, mac L'Oreal, yep, 'cause I'm worth it
Love the way I put it on so perfect
Wipe the corners of my mouth so I work it

That's probably the reason why these boys got crushes

'Yes, Ms. McClarkson?'
'She like, 'girl, ran out of my lip gloss, and
Write down where you get yours from
'Cause I must admit
That bubblegum
Is popping, is popping, is popping.'
She ain't fronting
And, uh

I be using it, I be, I be using it, and, uh
