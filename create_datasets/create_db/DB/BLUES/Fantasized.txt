I heard her soft hand knock in the dead of night
I hear her whisper, "Baby, let me in"
I sat up in my bed
"She's hear", my heart cried

Just like I fantasized
Just like I fantasized

I opened up my door and smelled her sweet perfume
Opened up my arms and smelled her satin skin
She said, "I'm yours tonight"
A fire glowed in her eyes

Just like I fantasized
Just like I fantasized
Just like I fantasized

She waits on tables at my favorite cafe
I tease and tempt her with games we can play
This evening with dinner she served me a smile
She said, "I'll be back when I get off tonight"

She had sugar-sweet lips and magical hips
Just like I fantasized
What a slow ride, she moaned and she cried
Just like I fantasized

I've dreamed of her at least a thousand times
Loved her a thousand ways all in my mind
And now I feel
The dream is by my side

Just like I fantasized
Just like I fantasized
