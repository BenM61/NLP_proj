Sunday morning, nine A.M.
I saw fire in the sky
I felt my heart pound in my chest
I heard an eagle cry

Hey!

I'm alive when I breathe the air
I feel the wind smell the earth in the air
I watch an eagle rise above the trees
Project myself into what he sees

So take me away 
Come on fly me away 
Lift me up so high
Where eagles fly 

I often dreamed that I could sail through the sky
I've always wished I could fly
The simple life of a bird on the wing
Oh, Lord, I could sing

Take me away 
Come on, fly me away 
Lift me up so high

Where eagles fly

Now I'm alive and I breathe the air
They wash the earth from my face
I catch a glimpse of another dream
I turned, I looked, I turned and looked again, 'cause I see no trace

Take me away
Come on, fly me away
I want to fly away, yeah

Pick me up so high

Where eagles fly

Yeah
Oh, yeah!
C'mon baby!

Where eagles fly
Come on take me away
I want to fly away
Where eagles fly
You can run me away
Chase me away
Sail me away
Fly me away
Run away with me, baby
Where eagles fly		

Oh, yeah...
