Yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah

Whatever's asked to me I perform,
I rip through the rain into the eye of the storm,
Still carrying the flame, eye of the torch,
Failure comes at a price I can't afford,
Never been half hearted I put my all in,
Forfeited all just to answer my calling,
Wearing the scars of the wars that I fought in,
Should'a been heading for the stars but I'm falling,

I have your
If you need them I'll be swimming in the lake,
Oh baby don't look down, just take the crown.

We'll be kings forever, oh oh oh,
Holding on together, oh oh oh,
Feeling so much better oh oh oh,
When everything was wrong and everything was gone
We ran to Avalon.

I fought till I had the fight left,
Risked my death,
Walked with conviction in everyone of my steps,
My strengths water enough,
To wash away any of the stains on my rep,
Yeah, I fought off voulcher's,
Went against odds when I was short and soldiers,
I asked not for my burden to be lightened
But if I may have broader shoulders
So as I may carry the weight all the doubt I had in me has been ?
So from now til the day I'm carried away
I will never walk around what stands in my way
F*ck if they ain't letting off cos neither will I
When I die from the ashes any ?
Long as my ? and my faith keep me alive
Fear is something you will see in my eyes.

We'll be kings forever, oh oh oh,
Holding on together, oh oh oh,
Feeling so much better oh oh oh,
When everything was wrong and everything was gone
We ran to Avalon.

I left competion out for the count no abacus
Fought for the crowd, fought down challengers
When my massacre was ordained
I remained through pain forged my sword, my Excalibur.

We'll be kings forever, oh oh oh,
Holding on together, oh oh oh,
Feeling so much better oh oh oh,
When everything was wrong and everything was gone
We ran to Avalon.
