I'm walking down the street looking fine
Shaking the expression makin' it mine
I'm walking down the street two feet, not four!
I know about impression, the guy in the back
Like the wind, like the wind
Like the wind, like the wind
Like the wind, like the wind
I like oo-ooh oooh

I feel it coming, it's blowing all strong
I know I got you, ooh ooo-ooh oh oh
I feel it coming, it's blowing all strong
I know I got you, ooh ooo-ooh oh oh

You're walking down the street feeling old burn
Shaking the expression makin' it mine
You're walking down the street momma all mind
I know about impression, the guy in the back
Like the wind, like the wind
Like the wind, like the wind
Like the wind, like the wind
I like oo-ooh oooh

I feel it coming, it's blowing all strong
I know I got you, ooh ooo-ooh oh oh
I feel it coming, it's blowing all strong
I know I got you, ooh ooo-ooh oh oh
Uuuu-uhuuu

Like the wind, like the wind
Like the wind, like the wind
I like ooo-ooh oooh

I feel it coming, it's blowing all strong
I know I got you, ooh ooo-ooh oh oh
I feel it coming, it's blowing all strong
I know I got you, ooh ooo-ooh oh oh
