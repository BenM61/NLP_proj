Nassau's gone funky
Nassau's gone soul
We've got a doggone beat now

We gonna call our very own

Nassau rock and Nassau roll
Nassau's got a whole lotta soul

Huh
Feel alright

Mini skirts and maxi skirts
And afro-haired dudes
People doin' their own thing
They don't care 'bout me or you

Nassau's gone funky
Nassau's gone soul, now, ah yeah
And we've got a doggone beat now
We're gonna take care of business too

Listen to the drummer, lay down his beat
Listen to the bass man go get that same groovy beat

Nassau rock and Nassau roll
Nassau's got a whole lotta soul

People doin' their own thing
They don't care 'bout me or you
