Here's a gory kind a story about a ole be freak
With a forty-inch waist and a ten-inch beak
Overweight and out a shape with a triple chin
Her brassiere strike fear in the hearts of men

The girl's a Bremelo
The girl's a Bremelo

Me and Terry hoped the ferry we were lookin' suave
When I dip, hit the shift we were almost horse
It was a big Bremelo standin' on my toe
Had an over jelly belly tryin' to say hello
I was really kind a frightened as she looked my way
I tried to run because her buns made the ferry sway
To be blunt she was fat and ready for combat
All the way to Bremerton were the fat is at

The girl's a Bremelo
Let's go

I love bacon over steak and about those big ole ducks
She had hairy underarms and a whopping gut
My hair was short and wavy, drove my pit bull crazy
A Bremerton beast chasin' fellas in the Navy
After movie she's the feature, the Bremerton creature
You wear a life jacket if you ever try to freak her
Look at her physique she ain't my kinda freak
The floor creaks when the beast starts reachin' her peak

The girl's a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo
Change the beat!

You can't ignore the way she snores, cause she blows down doors
Baby's got the kind a face only a mother adores
A big basketball head with a 10-inch beak
Big lips, no hips with the smell of a beast
I couldn't put her in my Caddy or my tranny would break
I heard a dirt because of poverty, but she took my cake
When it comes to cool-Aid the girl would drink it in pints
You go to school for twenty years and your still in the ninth?

You're just a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo

You pink triple-chin unattractive duck
Your boyfriend beats freaks up to make a buck
Hangin' round third and Pike, on a ten-speed bike
You can say that I'm a liar, but you know I'm right
You talk behind my back, because I dropped you flat
And you never take a shower 'cause your too damn fat
So your man was smart when he broke your heart
Because if Mix-A-Lot a cut ya, you a fell apart
Wearin' polyester slacks, with elastic in the back
You could flatten Schwarzenegger in a wrestling match
You got lips like a character in some cartoon
With a pink posterior, you big baboon

Your just a

Now Bremerton's a city right outside of mine
Most girls there are ducks, but a few are fine
But the ones that I speak about
Used their face for catchin' trout
Vacuum clears for a mouth
You know what I'm talkin' about
Mud ducks, hockey pucks, drivers of Mack trucks
Lame brains, diesel trains, pick 'em up you have to strain
Big butt, crew cut, extraordinary gut
Big momma, kinda buff, facial hairs a kinda rough

Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck
Girl's a Bremelo
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck
The girl's a Bremelo
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck
