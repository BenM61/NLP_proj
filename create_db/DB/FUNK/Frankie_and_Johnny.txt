Frankie and Johnny was sweethearts
At least that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports car to his Ivy League clothes

Oh, he was a man alright
Oh, but he was doing her wrong
Just to show you what can happen

A friend came running to Frankie
She said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Nellie Blye

Oh, if he was your man, honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

Frankie ran around the corner
And peeked in a swinging place
And there she saw Johnny with a woman
He had his arms around her waist

Oh, he was a man alright
But Frankie could see that he was doing her wrong
And oh, let me tell you

Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long forty-four
She shot once, twice, three times
And Johnny fell on the hard wood floor

Oh, he was a man alright
But she shot him because he was doing her wrong

But the last thing he told her was
Frankie, you know I love you
Why? Honey, why did you do that?
Frankie, I was telling her about you
Frankie, you know I love you
Frankie, you know that I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now Frankie, you know good and well that I love you
Frankie, I'll always love you, baby
Frankie, you know I can't do without you
Frankie, you know I love you
And I know, and I know I was doing you wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong, let me tell you
Frankie, baby, you know I love you
