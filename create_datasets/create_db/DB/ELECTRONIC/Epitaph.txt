Too many souls just fade away
And leave nothing behind
Too many live just for the day
And let their time pass by

Too many graves stay nameless
In the garden of the dead
Too many pictures frameless
Blurred lost memories

Do not search this place for me 
Search for me deep in your heart 
If I haven't built my memorial there 
My life has been in vain

So I must not fear the time 
When the reaper shows its face 
My memorial will shine 
Brighter than the sun 

Let come the night, the final day 
To retreat forever 
My soul will sweep away 
And will not be forgotten 

Do not search this place for me
Search for me deep in your heart
If I haven't built my memorial there
My life has been in vain
