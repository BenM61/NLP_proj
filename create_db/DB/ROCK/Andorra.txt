The nearer we got to Andorra
The sun set on the left
The rounded mountains pointed
To the black clouds in the West 

Hey, there's a darkness
In the sky that's not the night
Hey, there's a rain cloud there
That's shutting out the light 

(Chorus:)
What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain 

As soon as we reached Barcelona
The cold wind touched the beach
The sun we left in London
Is away beyond our reach 

Hey, I said darling:
It seems a waste of time
Hey, all I do is sit 
And drink our Spanish wine 

What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain 

Of all the tales of Granada 
They tell of Islam's run
They lived beneath the Moorish lord
Beneath a Moorish sun

Oh, how we yearned to turn 
Our faces to that glare
When down from the mountains
Came the rain to soak our hair 

What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain 

What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain
