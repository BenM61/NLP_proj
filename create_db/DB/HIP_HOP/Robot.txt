Hey I was born less than human 
I know it sounds crazy 
But I was really born a robot as a baby 
No real life in me, I just played my role 
No self control, I just did what I was told 
I got my first order, I was just a day old 
But I didn't have a chance, cause my heart was way cold 
My heart took the order, it couldn't break the mold 
Sold under bondage and I couldn't take control 
So I was just chilling in my robot clothes 
With my robot friends, and my robot flows 
Living robot ways, cause that's all I know 
Till I heard I could be freed from my robot soul, I'm like

[Chorus]
Why you always trying to control me? 
You are not my boss that's the old me 
Obviously you don't know my style 
I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a Robot 
I'm not a, I'm not a Robot now
I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a Robot 
I'm not a, I'm not a Robot now

The crazy thing is I ain't know I was robot 
So I ain't have a whole lot of plans for me to roll out 
I thought I was unique, I thought I was so hot 
But I was just like them other drones, I was so locked 
Brainwashed, I was listening to lies 
The freedom that I thought I had was really a mirage 
I made my own choices, but it was a disguise 
The only thing I really did was pick a different lie 
So I was still a drone, nothing but a clone 
I only knew the lies cause that's all that I was shown 
But I been remade, my heart is no longer stone 
Where my X-Robots who can sing this song? 
Now I've been remade, I'm no longer hollow 
A real man came, changed everything that I know 
He gave me truth, that's a hard pill to swallow 
He gave me new commands, and he freed me up to follow 

[Chorus]

I am not your robot, I am not a clone 
You are not my puppeteer and I am not a drone 
Got a new master and I follow Him alone 
I want a good life till I'm gone 

Hey world, you know I see your game 
And I don't need your lies, I ain't worried bout a thing 
Hey devil, I know you want me chained 
But you have been defeated, and your power has been drained 
Hey flesh, I know you bear my name 
I know you love the lies, but I'm steady tryna change 
You mighta been confused, but this a new day 
I'm saved now, I ain't gotta do what you say! 
To my friends, who are still on lock down 
Still controlled by their passions, stop now 
He can free everybody from the top down 
If you're freed up, say this with me right now 

I'm not a, I'm not a Robot now 
I'm not a, I'm not a Robot now 
I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a Robot 
I'm not a, I'm not a Robot now

[Chorus]
