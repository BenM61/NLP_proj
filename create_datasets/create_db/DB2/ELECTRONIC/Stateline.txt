Just you and me and a Marxist gun 
Heaven knows you've got a lot to learn 
Fall in love or take your time 
Don't you know 
You've gotta take your turn 
Son, your ambition's way too high 
Once you're gone misquoted apathy 
Your pacifier broken heart's 
So much better than your reverie (you'll ever be) 

Well on every state line 
I'm workin' on love 
I'm workin' on you 
Well on every state line 
I'm workin' on love 
I'm workin' on you 

Forget the love 
Forget the fun 
Can depend on every word I say 
Don't take no shit from anyone 
Can't accept you right away 
Well, don't offend my heart with love 
As imitation lovers do 
Just motivate your callous heart 
Don't you know this time the joke's on you 

On every state line 
I'm workin' on love 
I'm workin' on you 
On every state line 
I'm workin' on love 
I'm workin' on you 

Persecution on your hands 
Observations of a refugee, oh yeah 
Oh making love with one so dear 
Emulation of a strategy 
Your proposition's way too high 
Your criminal connections start, oh yeah 
The pressure of your body down 
Consummation of a naked heart, yeah 

Well on every state line 
I'm workin' on love 
I'm workin' on you 
Well on every state line 
I'm workin' on love 
I'm workin' on you 

Pushin' on, baby 
Well on every state line 
I'm workin' on love, my love
