Jonah was a man who got a word from the Lord
"Go and preach the Gospel to the sinful land"
But he got on a ship and he tried to get away
And he ran into a storm in the middle of the sea

Now the Lord, He made the waves just roll so high
The ship begin to sink and they all begin to cry
So they pulled old Jonah out of the hold
And they dumped him in the water just to lighten up the load

Now the Lord made a whale, long and wide
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
And he swallowed up Jonah, hair and hide
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord

Now Jonah started to pray in the belly of the whale
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
He repented of his sins like a man in jail
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord

Now Jonah must've been a bad man; he must of been a sinner
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
'Cause when the whale got him down, he didn't like his dinner
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord

Well, he swum around the ocean, sick as he could be
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
And after three days, whoops, he had to set him free
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish, mmm?

So the whale spit Jonah out onto dry land
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
And he went on to preaching like a righteous man
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?

Then the people quit their sins when they heard him in the town
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
So when you hear the call, don't you turn the Gospel down
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish, hmmm?
