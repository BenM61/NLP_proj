Snow-bound siren in the winter dawn 
There's a blizzard blowing in from off the river 
It's ten below out on these city streets, 
But the feeling in your heart is even colder 

The sunrise screeching down the line 
And the fog banks running out of time, 
But you won't be here when they creep in tomorrow 
You're tired of dreaming someone else's dreams 

When they really don't include you any longer 
Miles from home, you're sliding down with each day 
And you need a woman's love to make you stronger 
And lately you've been getting doubts 

A voice inside keeps calling out 
That someone else's dreams don't get you nowhere. 
So shut the suitcase, kiss the year goodbye 
Don't let nobody stop you at the doorway 

And close the shutters on this empty room 
Where these crazy dreams come crawling to devour you 
And head on out across that line 
Where she's been waiting all this time 

And tell her that you want her there forever. 
It's still two hours till this plane gets down 
Can hardly bear to wait another minute 
Your sweet loving babe is all that I need 

Darling it's been building up inside of me 
Tonight we'll go and paint this town 
We're gonna drink champagne, till we both fall down 
And we'll find some other crazy dream tomorrow.
