I'm a son of mother nature
A son of father time
I've got a lot of neighbours the million stars that shine
And there all friends of mine

Every robin is my brother 
They sing their songs to me 
The tiny black-eyed daisies
The mighty red wood tree
There all my familly

Then why do I feel so lonely
Like a king on an empty throne
There's one thing that's missing only
A true love to call my own

Won't you listen mother nature
And listen father time
Please help me to find someone
To fill these arms of mine
Mother nature and father time

musical interlude
  
Then why do I feel so lonely
Like a king on an empty throne
There's one thing that's missing only
A true love to call my own

Won't you listen mother nature
And listen father time
Please help me to find someone
To fill these arms of mine
Mother nature and father time
Mother nature and father time
