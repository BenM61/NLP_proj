Did you see it?
It was so easy

Did you see it?
It was so easy

It's been so long that it's all been forgotten
It's been so long that I would not know

Would'ja b'lieve it?
It was so easy

Would'ja b'lieve it?
It was so easy

Don't shoot the messenger it's not his fault
It's just a drag when you're the last one to know

Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie

Did you see it?
It was so easy

Did you see it?
It was so easy

Four years ago this would not be true
Four years ago is a lifetime to me

Would'ja b'lieve it?
It was so easy

Would'ja b'lieve it?
It was so easy

I found out when I saw my family
I'll sing this song so that I will remember

Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie

Lifetime
Lifetime
Lifetime
Lifetime

Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie
