It was Valentine's Day February 14th
My baby took me to a special place
Said he had a surprise for me
He told me to close my eyes
So that I could not see
And when I opened them up
He was one knee reachin' for my hand
(That's when)

He proposed to me
He proposed with a diamond ring
I started crying
He placed it on my finger and I said Yes
He proposed to me (My Baby)
He proposed with a diamond ring
I couldn't  believe it I looked in his eyes and I said Yes

I'll never forget that night
It was 8:43 pm to be precise
He looked in my eyes and said
You've made me the happiest man alive
And as soon as I got home
I called my mother on the phone
I said mama you won't believe
What just happened to me

He proposed to me
He proposed with a diamond ring
I couldn't believe it
I looked in his eyes and I said Yes

We will be together
This I know
We will love forever (Baby)
My heart told me so
See if you promise to hold me tight
And never let me go
We'll be husband and wife
For the rest of our lives
