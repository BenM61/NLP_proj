The facts and the figures
They overwhelm and stifle
Everything that you thought you knew

The facts and the figures
They overwhelm and stifle
From the very first breath you drew

The facts and the figures
They overwhelm and stifle
And the petty decisions
That you think make a difference

So tiny that they blow away like dust
So tiny that they blow away like dust
So tiny that they blow away like dust

Through all the devilish things we do
Through all the devilish things we do
Through all the devilish things we do
Through all the devilish things we do

Through all the devilish things we do
(I can't help my stupid hopes)
Through all the devilish things we do
(I can't help my stupid hopes)
Through all the devilish things we do
(I can't help my stupid hopes)

Through all the devilish things we do
(I can't help my stupid hopes)
Through all the devilish things we do
(I can't help my stupid hopes)

Facts and the figures
The overwhelming stifling
Everything that you thought you knew

So tiny that they blow away like dust
We are all embers from the same fire
We are all embers from the same fire
We are all embers from the same fire
We are all embers from the same fire
