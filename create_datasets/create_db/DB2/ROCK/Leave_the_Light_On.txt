I seen myself with a dirty face, 
I cut my luck with a dirty ace 
I leave the light on 
I went from zero to minus ten 
I drank your wine then 
I stole your man 
I leave the light on, 
I leave that light on. 

Daddy ain't that bad he just plays rough
I ain't that scarred when I'm covered up 
I leave the light on 
Little girl hiding underneath the bed was it something I did 
Must be something I said 
I leave the light on, better leave the light on. 

I want to love 
I want to live 
I don't know much about it 
I never did seventeen and I'm all messed up inside 
I cut myself just to feel alive 
I leave the light on twenty one on the run 
on the run on the run from myself 

From myself and everyone 
I leave the light on, I leave the light on 
Better leave the light on. 

Cause I want to love 
I want to live 
I don't know much about it 
I never did, 
I don't know what to do, can the damage be undone 
I swore to God that I'd never be what I've become 
Lucky stars and fairy tales 
I'm gonna bathe myself in a wishin' well 
Pretty scars from cigarettes 
I never will forget, I never will forget 
I'm still afraid to be alone 
wish that moon would follow me home 
I leave the light on 
I ain't that bad I'm just messed up 
I ain't that sad but I'm sad enough 
God bless the child with the dirty face who cuts her luck with a dirty ace 
She leaves the light on, I leave that light on
