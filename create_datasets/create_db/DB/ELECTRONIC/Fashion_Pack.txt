It was night and suddenly I felt like dancing
I took a cab to show me to the disco scene
He said: o.k.
You wanna see those crazy people
Hastling at the door to get into Studio 54.
Well, I was in and everybody was "travolting"

The fashion queens
The models and the movie stars
Andy snapping
Margaux dancing with Scavullo
Liza dancing on the floor and Bianca walking through the door.

Who is in? Who is out? Tell me
Tell me, tell me
Who is in? Who is out? Famous and trendy.

In people always have to smile in Vogue
They only travel by Concorde
Doing things you can't afford.
They are the fashion pack
People you see in the magazines
They are the fashion pack
They're always smiling in theit limousines
They only come on their trendy track
They are the fashion pack.
In Paris you got to be seen at Maxim's
The Palace
The "7" and then go Chez Regine
Champagne
Caviar
Haute-coututer
Expensive cars
Saint Laurent and Loulou
Rich ladies with a few bijoux.
Who is in ? Who is out ? Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Who is in ? Who is out ? Woman's wear Dally.

Rock stars sniffing
While Marisa's posing
Paloma's counting her paintings
The models of Zoli flirting.
They are the fashion pack
People you see in the magazines
They are the fashion pack
They're always smiling in theit limousines
They only come on their trendy track
They are the fashion pack.

They are the fashion pack
They read a lot of silly magazines
Like to sit around gossiping
In the back of their limousines.
They are the fashion pack

People you see in the magazines
They are the fashion pack
They only come out after dark
Got to keep on their trendy track
They are the fashion pack.

Hey
What's your name
Didn't I see you in Interview last month
Or was it the Ritz
Gee
You're so famous
May I have your autograph.
It's a holi-holiday
