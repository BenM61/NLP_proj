I take each breath as if it is my first
I hold it there, so deep inside me
Til I'm about to burst
I speak each word as if it is your name
I move my lips...I see the whisper
Stir the gentle flame

Your heart beats and so does mine
Your love moves
And I know I'm alive

You are mu oxygen
I breathe you in
I breathe you out
You are my oxygen
You are my love
You are my wath life's about

I take each breath as if it is my last
You never know wath came so slowly
Could leave us, oh, so fast
I take each step as if it is to you
I hear your voice
I feel your presence
In everything I do

My soul sleeps, your love revives
Our hearts meet
And I know I'm alive

You are my oxygen
I breathe you in
I breathe you out
You are my oxygen
You are my love
You are my wath life's about

You are my oxygen
You are my love
You are what life's about
