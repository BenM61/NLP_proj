As I get closer, my dreams get farther
I climb the ladder, but you kick it over
Thirsty for water, you give me vinegar
When I drink your medicine, it just makes me sicker

I dug a hole so deep
I'm gonna drown in my mistakes
Can't even sell my soul
'Cause it ain't worth shit to take

I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over
And I just can't sink any lower, lower and lower
The hounds of hell are getting closer, closer and closer
I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over

Follow the rainbow, my lucky omen
There ain't no pot of gold, just copper tokens
I found the key to life, but the lock was broken
All my accomplishments are best left unspoken

I dug a hole so deep
I'm gonna drown in my mistakes
Can't even sell my soul
'Cause it ain't worth shit to take

I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over
And I just can't sink any lower, lower and lower
The hounds of hell are getting closer, closer and closer
I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over

My horror story is nearly over
I said I'm sorry, but I was sober
I beg for mercy from my infernal friend
The one that drives the nails into my coffin

I've got the devil on my shoulder
I've got the devil on my shoulder

I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over
And I just can't sink any lower, lower and lower
They've come to take me, take me over, over and over
I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over
