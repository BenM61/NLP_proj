Imagine a place only your soul can vision
The heart of a child who looks, sees and listens
She paints a picture using every color
And what she sees, she sees is like no other

[Chorus:]
One word, a voice unheard
You can change the world
With everything I know you're made of
One word, a voice unheard
You can change the world
If everyone would stop and listen

The art of innocence make so much sense
But placed in the wrong hands, well then it's wasted
Filtered through the eyes of a pure mind
A one-of-a-kind paradise for you and I

[Chorus]
One word, a voice unheard
You can change the world
With everything I know you're made of
One word, a voice unheard
You can change the world
If everyone would stop and listen

Break the cycle, find your rhythm
Share the gift that you've been given

You can
You can change the world
You can change the world

[Chorus x2]
One word, a voice unheard
You can change the world
With everything I know you're made of
One word, a voice unheard
You can change the world
If everyone would stop and listen
