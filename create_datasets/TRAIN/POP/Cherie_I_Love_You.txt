Cherie, Cherie, je t'aime
Cherie, listen again

I only know that I love you so
I can't pretend that I don't
You know

Cherie, Cherie, je t'aime
Do not say it's in vain

I love you, love you
That's all I need
When I whisper
Cherie, je t'aime

I love you, love you
That's what I need
When I whisper
Cherie, je t'aime

I love you, love you
That's all I need
When I whisper
Cherie, je t'aime

I love you, love you
That's what I need
When I whisper
Cherie, je t'aime
