I changed my name in search of fame to find the Midas touch
Oh I wish I'd never wanted then what I want now, twice as much
We crossed the mighty oceans and we had a few divides
But we never crossed emotion, for we felt too much inside

You know all the tales we tell, you know the band so well
Still I feel, somehow, we let you down
We went off somewhere on the way and now I see we have to pay
The rock n' roll circus is in town

Buffin' lost his child-like dreams and Mick lost his guitar
And Verden grew a line or two and Overend's just a rock n' roll star
Behind these shades, the visions fade, as I learn a thing or two
Oh but if I had my time again you all know just what I'd do

Rock n' roll's a loser's game, it mesmerizes and I can't explain
The reasons for the sights and for the sounds
We went off somewhere on the way and now I see we have to pay
The rock n' roll circus is in town

So rock n' roll's a loser's game, it mesmerizes and I can't explain
The reasons for the sights and for the sounds
The greasepaint still sticks to my face, so what the hell I can't erase
The rock n' roll feeling from my mind

From my mind
From my mind
From my mind
