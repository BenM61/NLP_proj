Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye
Na na na na na na na na
Hey hey hey goodbye

He'll never love you
The way that I love you
'Cause if he did no,
No he wouldn't make you cry

(bridge)
He might be thrilling baby but my love's
So dog-gone willing so kiss him,
Go on and kiss him goodbye

Na na na na na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye

He's never near you
To comfort and cheer you,
When all those sad tears are
Falling baby from your eyes

(bridge)
Na na na na na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye
