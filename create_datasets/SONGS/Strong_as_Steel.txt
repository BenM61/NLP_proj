We've been so close to each other 
Can't think of a moment 
That you weren't there 
We've been through so much together 

Can't think of a feeling 
That we haven't shared 
Ooh how many lovers 
Ever found the kind of love that we got 

Ooh there ain't many others 
'Cause you know what we've got is a real thing  
Oh it's ever lasting 

This love is as strong as steel 
Can't break it up or break it down 
It's always gonna be around 
This love is a love that's real 
It's as deep as any ocean goes 
It's gonna last don't you know, 
This love is strong as steel 

We've been right here for each other 
Even through the times when 
Times were hard for us 
When it rained we came through shining 
Always knew we'd make it 
All it takes is trust 
Ooh and now there's nothing 
That could ever come between you and me 
Ooh our love is one thing 
That just keeps on getting better 
The more that we're together 

This love is as strong as steel 
Can't break it up or break it down 
It's always gonna be around 
This love is a love that's real 
It's as deep as any ocean goes 
It's gonna last don't you know 
This love is strong as steel 
There ain't no rainy weather 
That's gonna sweep this love away 
We're gonna stand together heart to heart 
And nothin's gonna tear this love apart 

This love is as strong as steel 
Can't break it up or break it down 
It's always gonna be around 
This love is a love that's real 
It's as deep as any ocean goes 
It's gonna last don't you know 
This love is strong as steel 

This love is as strong as steel 
This love is a love that's real 
It's as deep as any ocean goes 
It's gonna last don't you know
