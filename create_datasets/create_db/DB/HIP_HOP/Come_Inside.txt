Let me come inside
I'll keep you satisfied tonight
If you want me if you need me
Turn down all the lights
I'll make you feel alright tonight
Come inside, come inside

I'm thinking about you
The last time we made love
And I fantasize so many things
That I dream of

I wanna do with you, baby
And tonight won't be the same
I wanna come inside
I like to hear you call my name

Slowly I'll give it to you, baby
Only if you promise me
You'll let your mind run free
Grab a hold and love me totally

I wanna slip and slide dip and dive
Do everything to make it alright tonight
Just let me come inside, oh baby

Baby just imagine I can do anything
Please can I set your body on fire
Or sooth your soul with ease

Just a kiss I'll taste your sweet, sweet lips
All of the passion I have inside of me
I know you won't forget

Let me rub you down move in closer now
Hold on tight and don't let go
Coming home together, baby
Vamp
