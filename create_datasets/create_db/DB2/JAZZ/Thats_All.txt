I can only give you love that lasts forever
And the promise to be near each time you call
And the only heart I own for you and you alone
That's all, that's all

I can only give you country walks in springtime
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And the love whose burning light will warm the winter's night
That's all, that's all

There are those I am sure who have told you
They would give you the world for a toy
All I have are these arms to enfold you
And a love time can never destroy

If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and evermore
That's all, that's all

There are those I am sure who have told you
They would give you the world for a toy
All I have are these arms to enfold you
And a love time can never destroy

If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you'll adore, yes me that you'll adore
For now and evermore, that's all
