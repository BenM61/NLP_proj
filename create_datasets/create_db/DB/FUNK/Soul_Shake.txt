Do do do do

Dancing with your baby
Really turning the soul shake on
Grooving with your baby
Really turning the soul shake on

I'm a woman possessed
By the way you move
There ain't nothing bout you, baby
That I don't approve

Come on, come on, baby
Let's ball the whole day long

And the dance hall's a cooking
Like a great big honeycomb
And all the bees inside
Is humming and a singing a song

I'm a king bee, baby
Buzzing in his hive
Well buzz on, honey
'Cause I'm digging that jive

Do it, do it together
Let's ball the whole day long

Do do do do

Well, there ain't nobody else
In the whole wide world like you
No, no, nobody else turn me on
Baby, like you do

When you go like that
I nearly flip my mind
Ah, when you do it, do it, baby
Oh, you're fine, so fine

'Cause dancing with your baby
Really turn the soul shake on
Look

Do do do do
