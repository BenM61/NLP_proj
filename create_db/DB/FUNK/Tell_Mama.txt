You thought you had found yourself a good girl,
One who would love you and give you the world.
Then you find, babe, that you've been misused,
Come to me, honey, I'll do what you choose.

She'd embarrass you anywhere, 
She'd make her friends think that she didn't care 

Give me the chance and I'd been begging 
And I just want to take care of you and I want you to 

Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need 
Tell Mama, what you want and I'll make everything alright

The girl you had didn't have no sense, 
She wasn't worth all the time that you spent 
Had another man throw you out the door, 
Now that same man is wearing your clothes 

I want you to
Tell your Mama, what you want, tell your Mama, what you need 
Tell your Mama, what you got to have
