I think it's getting to the point
Where I can be myself again
I think it's getting to the point
Where we have almost made amends
I think it's the getting to the point
That is the hardest part

And if you call, I will answer
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
And if you court this disaster
I'll point you home
I'll point you home

You think I only think about you
When we're both in the same room
You think I'm only here to witness
The remains of love exhumed
You think we're here to play
A game of who loves more than whom

And if you call, I will answer
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
And if you court this disaster

You think it's only fair to do what's best for
You and you alone
You think it's only fair to do the same to me
When you're not home
I think it's time to make this something that is
More than only fair

So if you call, I will answer
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
And if you court this disaster
I'll point you home

But I'm warning you, don't ever do
Those crazy, messed-up things that you do
If you ever do
I promise you I'll be the first to crucify you
Now it's time to prove that you've come back here to rebuild
Rebuild
Rebuild
Rebuild
Rebuild
Rebuild
Rebuild
Rebuild
Rebuild
Rebuild
Rebuild, oh

Oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh
