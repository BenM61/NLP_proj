[Chorus:]
Lollipop lollipop 
Oh lolli lolli lolli 
Lollipop lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli 
Lollipop lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli 
Lollipop (pop)

[Repeat Chorus:]
 
Call my baby lollipop 
Tell you why 
His kiss is sweeter than an apple pie 
And when he does his shaky rockin' dance 
Man, I haven't got a chance 

I call him 

[Chorus:]
Lollipop lollipop 
Oh lolli lolli lolli 
Lollipop lollipop..... 

Sweeter than candy on a stick 
Huckleberry, cherry or lime 
If you had a choice 
He'd be your pick 
But lollipop is mine 

[Chorus:]
Lollipop lollipop 
Oh lolli lolli lolli 
Lollipop lollipop..... 

Crazy way he thrills me 
Tell you why 
Just like a lightning from the sky 
He loves to kiss me till I can't see straight 
GEE, MY LOLLIPOP IS GREAT 

I call him 
[Chorus:]
Lollipop lollipop 
Oh lolli lolli lolli 
Lollipop lollipop..... 

[Repeat Chorus:]
