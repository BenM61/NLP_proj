Call on your angels
Come down to the city
Crowd around the big tree
All you strangers who know me
Bring your compassion
Your understanding
Lord how we need it
On this New York City Christmas

Yeah I'm sending you a Merry New York Christmas
And a prayer for peace on earth within our time
And the sidewalk angels echo hallelujah
We understand them
Now more than ever

So call on your angels 
Your beaten and broken
It's time that we mend them
So they don't fade with the season

Let our mercy be the gifts we lay
From Brooklyn to Broadway
Celebrate each and every day
Of this New York City Christmas

Yeah I'm sending you a Merry New York Christmas
And a prayer for peace on earth within our time
And the sidewalk angels echo hallelujah
We understand them
Now more than ever
Merry New York Christmas

Call on your angels
Come down to the city
Lets crowd around the big tree
All you strangers who know me
Bring your compassion
Bring your forgiveness
Lord how we need it
On this New York City Christmas

Yeah I'm sending you a Merry New York Christmas
And a prayer for peace on earth, it's not too late
And the sidewalk angels echo hallelujah
We understand them
We understand
Now more than ever
Merry New York Christmas
It's a New York City Christmas

Merry New York Christmas
