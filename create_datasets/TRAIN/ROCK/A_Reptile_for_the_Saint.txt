For a friend
It makes no difference
If you please yourself in sense 
That will ease you to get plain 
You caught a racketeer
A ship that you can't steer when you're left behind
Hold your breath 
'cause you may need it soon 

When you're packed in your cocoon
And you erase the silver sun
It's like an open end
To choose what you've planned
When you're left inside
A fairytale will come and ease your day 
Don't be afraid
The bliss is on it's way 
It's coming straight
To take the fake away
Take the fake away?

Come to bed
And sleep will heal your pain
Embed yourself in fame
Like a reptile for the saint
No need to concentrate
Recede from all you hate
'cause you're leaving now
A fairytale will come and ease your day?
