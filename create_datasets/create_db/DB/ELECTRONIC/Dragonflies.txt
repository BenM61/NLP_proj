Just when did I decide you
And I how did I arrive at truth
Love's a very deadly thing
Swims and fills my viens with a dread

While I'm strapped to your bed
Your the banquet for desire
I wish the man of nine files my bliss
Seduction rides the wings of Dragonflies

Blinding softly right before my eyes
Blinding softly
Took my good eye off the door
Slipped and let my clothes fall to the floor, too quick

There were no riddles in your moves
Flown like a silk of wicked webs
I've fall into again
Seduction rides the wings of Dragonflies

Blinding softly right before my eyes
Seduction rides the wings of Dragonflies
Blinding softly
Just when did I decide you

And I how did I arrive at truth
Lust's a very deadly thing
Flows like a silk of wicked webs
I've fell into again

Seduction rides the wings of Dragonflies
Blinding softly right before my eyes
Seduction rides the wings of Dragonflies
Blinding softly

I've fell into again (softly)
