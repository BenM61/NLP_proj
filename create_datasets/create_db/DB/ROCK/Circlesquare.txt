Is that a smile that hangs beneath your nose
Or are your lips just stuck to your teeth 
And they're too fixed to close
You don't have to ham it up for me
Or tell me how long you've 
Waited just to be with me

I've been a long term disappointment to myself
But it hits like a hammer when I'm that to someone else
And the circle doesn't fit its little square
It bulges with opportunity bulges

I said is that a smile that hangs beneath your nose
Or are your eyes so wide 
They've pulled your mouth into a stupid pose
You don't have to ham it up for me
Or tell me how long you've 
Waited just to be with me

I've been a long term disappointment to myself
But it hits like a hammer when I'm that to someone else
And this circle doesn't fit its little square
It bulges with opportunity bulges
