Let's find a darker night
Let's find a brighter light
Let's go away to some place strange
And bring back a whole new change.

Let's find a different kind of sun
Let's find a different kind of fun
Let's go away just you and me
And do it all through the day.

(Ah,) Let's find a different set
(Ah,) I know we're gonna make it next.

After it all gets old
And after all the stories are told
We'll go away to some place strange
And bring back a whole new change.
