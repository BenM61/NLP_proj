Slowly we watch the degradation of the civilization
The rise and fall of all we are
Stands here before us

This place is evil
We stare in insult
This world is vile
We are the answer

How long until we die?
Die from the inside out
How much is enough for us to see the light?
How much blood must be shed?

Come past the lies
We cannot be so blind
Hear their cries
The wait 'til daylight dies
Daylight dies

We all have blood on our hands
How can we (how can we) ignore the sound?

Come past the lies
We cannot be so blind
Hear their cries
The wait 'til daylight dies

The cost of one life
The price of ones soul
Is too much to lose

No more broken promises
The shattered hearts will heal
No more broken promises
No more (no more)

Come past the lies
We cannot be so blind
Hear their cries
The wait 'til daylight dies

How long until it dies?
How long?
How long?
How long until it dies
How long?
How long?
