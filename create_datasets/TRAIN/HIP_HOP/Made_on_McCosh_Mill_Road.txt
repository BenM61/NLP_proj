I'm talking 'bout a cold bear, talking 'bout a hot country girl
I'm talking 'bout John dear, I'm talking 'bout my big cousin Earl
See I was made on my cas middle road
Where the rowdy fox come from
And if they ask you can tell 'em we drinking, we smoking
We'll do pretty much, anything but run

The graving line at the baring line
I was made of the Jordan side
Find a whole more in your pants
Find a shine, find a bill for that type of '
Find you kind, you chop down and compress top the address of a better sound
But come to me, we get the deal
Gonna pop that chop off is sweet that, we get the meal
Me and mom get turn off
That wood part get burgh up
Hottest hill but it's feel all like
Having me sure it does
Anybody just anybody plus no body that's everybody
Knows about that meal dog
Dead crows is dead around it, to be as cold and get women around
We came to have a good time tonight
But disrespect might get to hot

I'm talking 'bout a cold bear, talking 'bout a hot country girl
I'm talking 'bout John dear, I'm talking 'bout my big cousin Earl
See I was made on my cas middle road
Where the rowdy fox come from
And if they ask you can tell 'em we drinking, we smoking
We'll do pretty much, anything but run

I got my bear, bitch it's still like a mean night
Moon light my road is '
That's how we living that real life
Chevrolets and 'up about that gravel
It feels still with that mind like hell
But a bumper does not devil
Just drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Maybe do what anybody do
Man what did you think, my flow was a joke
Now buddy that must be you
Got met on the grill, the music is loud, we have American veil
In case they forgot this is my car get, tell 'em again
We party like anybody just talk about how they party
Take a wick of that pow water just to get my day started
Born here, was made here and I'mma stay here I'mma beat bear
Right on there on top of the hill'on cemetery

I'm talking 'bout a cold bear, talking 'bout a hot country girl
I'm talking 'bout John dear, I'm talking 'bout my big cousin Earl
See I was made on my cas middle road
Where the rowdy fox come from
And if they ask you can tell 'em we drinking, we smoking
We'll do pretty much, anything but run
