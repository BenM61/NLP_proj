Let me sigh, let me cry when I'm blue
Let me go way from this lonesome town
Won't be long til my song will be through
'Cause I know I'm on my last go round
All the love I could steal, beg or borrow
Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul

What is love but a prelude to sorrow
With a heartbreak ahead for your goal
Here I go
Now you know why I'm leaving
Got the blues
What can I lose
Good bye

All the love I could steal, beg or borrow
Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul

What is love, just a prelude to sorrow
With a heartbreak ahead for your goal
Here I go
Now you know why I'm leaving
Got the blues
What can I lose
Good bye
