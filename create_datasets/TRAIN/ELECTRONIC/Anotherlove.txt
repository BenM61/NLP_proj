You said I was what you wanted
Liar, liar.
You never wanted me that way.
I was just something U flaunted
Hired and fired
U never had a plant 2 stay...
If you don't like it, round here,
Find another love, another love.
Anyone can see it's so clear
I'll find another, another, another, another love
If U don't like this baby
Find another, another love
U don't have a right 2 fake it
Find another, another love
I tried to be what you wanted,
But I'm tired, I'm tired.
I don't really need you, anyway... No
The house we use to share it's now
Haunted, expired
A couple 100 days we'd have to pray. Amen
If you don't like it, round here,
Find another love, another love.
Anyone can see it's so clear
I'll find another, another, another, another love
If U don't like this baby
Find another, another love
U don't have a right 2 fake it
Find another, another love
Move on, move on,
Move on, move on,
Find another love, find another love.
I've got to find anotherlove.
(Another another love)
I used to think I was so much fun
Now I'm just the guilty one
Everything we used 2 share
Our clothes and even our hair.
Now all U see is what I did
But how come I can't tell me that kid
Behind my back I'm just a so and so
But I'm the greatest living soul
U'll ever know
