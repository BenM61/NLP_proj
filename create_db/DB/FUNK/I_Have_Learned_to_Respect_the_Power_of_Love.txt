A dee dee dee dee doo doo

I was a victim of my foolish thinking 
Carelessly I've risked my love and my life 
There's no self-pity, I admit I obliged 
Overpowered by love I pretended to be blind 

Faith has survived all the doubts I've summoned 
My heart has stood all the failure and loss 
Helpless I cannot further be driven, ooh, ooh 

I've learned to respect 
The power of love 
I've learned to respect (Oh)

Running away from the one thing 
for which I've always yearned
