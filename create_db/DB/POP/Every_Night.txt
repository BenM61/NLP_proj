Uh, uh, uh
You know they all say
That you?re much more than this best the face deserts
But they don't get you need
They don?t tell you 'cause your dignity comes first
I've got to keep you coming home!

I got to be with you every night
Got to be with you every night
Got to be with you every night
Got to be with you every night

Insulation
The battle's been fought and it's been won
You have told me you don't know where you run.
But I don't care 'cause you come back for my love
I always keep you coming home!

I got to be with you every night
Got to be with you every night
Got to be with you every night
Got to be with you every night

Too many times,
Too many times I have waited in line
Waited in line,
Waited my turn, but not tonight!
Tonight breaks established rules
Just tell me we've been caught up in for too long tonight!

I got to be with you every night
Got to be with you every night
Got to be with you every night
Got to be with you every night
Got to love you, got to love you!
