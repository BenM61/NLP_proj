Hubcaps and ashtrays
I was born but I wasn't raised
The big wheel the black space
Tried my best but wasn't praised

Hell is so close to Heaven
Hell is so close to Heaven

Hold on don't look back
You know we're better were better than that
Lost and thrown away
You know we're better were better than that

We are the strays (whoah)
We are the strays (whoah)

Train tracks to the stage
Play that role, the one you made
Long nights and the worst days
Lived it all, but I didn't break

Hell is so close to Heaven
Hell is so close to Heaven

Hold on don't look back
You know we're better were better than that
Lost and thrown away
You know we're better were better than that

We are the strays (whoah)
We are the strays (whoah)

My whole life they said I'd be nothing
Well I'm something
And I would rather be the stray
Than be nothing to no one at all

Hubcaps and ashtrays
I was born but wasn't raised

Hold on don't look back
You know were better were better than that
Lost and thrown away
You know we're better were better than that

Cause we are the strays (whoah)
We are the strays (whoah)
