Trapped beneath rotting remains
A slow decay of life takes its form

Withered death and bone emerge
From cemeteries of the earth
Replacing all that is known from this world

Towering structures take shape
As more cities are laid to waste

Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new
Misshapen and half mutated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew

Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign

A new society takes place
Where the way of the cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain

A kingdom of the damned

Carnal war consuming them by
Eating flesh for nourishment
Solution for a short-term survival

Slaughtered are the weakest first
Feeding those with evil thirst
As blood of the dead saturates the ground

Again the end has begun
Another kingdom will be damned

Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new

Misshapen and half mutated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew

Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign

A new society takes place
Where the way of the cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain

Survivors of this morbid fate
