There was a time when I stayed at home alone
I knew a lot of guys but none I could call my own
But when you came along my heart sang a brand new song
Now I'm happy, glad I found you and I'm not afraid to say

Welcome to my love
Come on in and make yourself at home
Welcome to my life
I know everything's gonna be alright

Needed a woman, said you need a girl that's just like me
You've had a lot of girlfriends but none in whom you can believe
Time just dragged along, you're tired of playin' the same old song
But now you're happy, glad I found you 'cause you're not afraid to say

Welcome to my love
Come on in and make yourself at home
Welcome to my life
I know everything is gonna be alright

Welcome to my love, baby
Come on in, take all you want
Welcome to my life
I know everything is gonna be alright

You are the only one for me, here is right where I wanna be
We're like two leaves on a vine, you know just what is on my mind
I just wish you could've been here in my life the whole time

Welcome to my love
Come on in and make yourself at home
Welcome to my life
I know everything's gonna be alright

Welcome to my love
Come on in and take all you want
Welcome to my life
I know everything is gonna be alright

Welcome to my love
Welcome to my life
Your welcome to

Welcome to my love, baby
Come on in, make yourself at home
Welcome to my life, baby
I know everything's gonna be alright

Welcome to my love, oh darling
Come on in and take all you
Welcome to my life
I know everything is gonna be alright

Welcome to my love
Welcome to my love
Welcome to my love
