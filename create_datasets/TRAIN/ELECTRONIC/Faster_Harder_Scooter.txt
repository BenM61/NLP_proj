Yeah!
Request
I want everybody as close to the stage as possible
Get there speed
We're going back to the heavy weight jams

Let's go out for a walk to the other side
Get the sound 
Join the crew
And you feel alright
No more victory
Go back to reality
It's the message 
So listen and you will see
No illusion
The spirit is what you feel
Get the volume
Tonight you can make it real
I explain once again
We won't let you down
We can't stop going on that's what I'm about

Faster, harder, scooter
We're getting faster harder scooter
We're getting faster harder scooter
We're getting faster harder scooter
Yeah!

Alright crew
Enjoy this track
Yes

From Japan and Brazil to the USA
Let me ask you if there is a better way
I believe in missing the time we had
Don't you know we just want you
Are going back
No bad rumors or chargers will make us stop
Now the time has come we will reach the top
I explain once again
We won't let you down
We can't stop going on that's what I'm about

Faster, harder, scooter
We're getting faster harder scooter
We're getting faster harder scooter
We're getting faster harder scooter
Yeah!

(Faster harder scooter)
Everybody shout
Yes
(Faster harder scooter)
Come on!
(Faster harder scooter)
Wonderful human beings

We're getting faster harder scooter
We're getting faster (faster) harder (harder) scooter (scooter)
Faster (faster) harder (harder) scooter (scooter)
