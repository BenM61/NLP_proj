Because I always feel like running
Not away, because there is no such place
Because, if there was I would have found it by now
Because it's easier to run
Easier than staying and finding out you're the only one
Who didn't run
Because running will be the way your life and mine
Will be described
As in "the long run"
Or as in having given someone a "run for his money"
Or as in "running out of time"
Because running makes me look like everyone else
Though I hope there will ever be cause for that
Because I will be running in the other direction
Not running for cover
Because if I knew where cover was
I would stay there and never have to run for it
Not running for my life
Because I have to be running for something of more value
To be running and not in fear
Because the thing I fear cannot be escaped
Eluded, avoided, hidden from, protected from, gotten away from
Not without showing the fear as I see it now
Because closer, clearer, no sir, nearer
Because you of you and because of that nice
That you quietly, quickly be causing
And because you're going to see me run soon
And because you're going to know why I'm running then
You'll know then
Because I'm not going to tell you now
