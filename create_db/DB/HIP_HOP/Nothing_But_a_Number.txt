Yeah this ya boy pleasure
The fine pleasure
To all the ladies who like pleasure
Age ain't nothin' but a number
Pretty Ricky and the mavericks

(It ain't nothing but a (lets go) number)
It ain't nothing but a number
(ain't nothing but a number)
It ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number yeah

You say it's because of my age girl
But age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number (number baby)
You say it's because of my age girl
But age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (number baby)

I'm a young man, but my dick grown up
I like to beat it up wit legs up sure 'nough
I'm the one you call when you want to get fucked.
Hit you in the house, in the car, in the truck.
Baby bend over, let me hit it from the back.
I'ma show you how Stella got her groove back.
How you feel like a little girl, sneakin' for your boyfriend
Leavin' your window cracked.
I get a phone call everyday weekly.
Legs open very easy the meanin' of L.O.V.E
Baby blue, B.A.B.Y.B.L.U.E.
Have you spellin' you my name in yo sleep.
I beat that drum like the energizer bunny.
Keep goin' and goin', goin' and goin'.
Show ya that an old man can't do ya like I can.
I'll flip it and keep ya moanin'.

You say it's because of my age girl
But age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number (number baby)
You say it's because of my age girl
But age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (number baby)

I know you been goin' through some changes.
People got you anglin' in different directions.
Now it's time for the best
Sit down on the bed gurl
Let me teach you what lesson I'm talkin' 'bout.
Havin' sex 'n' a little romance 'n' a little affection
I'm talking' 'bout headboard bangin'
Forget about them other ones, ain't nobody gonna do you like (ah)
Age ain't nothin' but a number girl
Tryin' to blow your mind and make you wonder girl
Trying to hit you with this thunder girl, trying to make this bedroom rumble girl
Say turn the page to another chapter 'cause you want matter nothin'
That's matter
I'm your servant, you're my master
I'm tryin' to climb this latter happily ever after

You say it's because of my age girl
But age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number (number baby)
You say it's because of my age girl
But age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (number baby)

Don't waste no time, just gimme your hand lets walk on the sand
Spend a couple of grand.
Approachin' your body with sex appeal.
On the real, you and me could just chill.
I'm talkin' 'bout back action, satisfaction,
Guaranteed wip lashes on your back.
Girl my love is everlastin', everlastin'.
I want to sign ya, and wine 'n' dine ya.
Spin you like DJ Rhyma.
Suck on your neck like a vampire.
You a bomb.
'Bout to blow up all you need is a big timer.
Don't worry 'bout age 'cause I'm 21, bout mines

You say it's because of my age girl
But age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothing but a number (number baby)
You say it's because of my age girl
But age ain't nothing but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (number baby)
