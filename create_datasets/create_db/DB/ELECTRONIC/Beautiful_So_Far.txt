I want your face to be like any other face 
I've known I wamt your stare to penetrate the places 
You've been shown I want your jacket to remain 
The colour I recall I want your words to sound 
Like candy or I'll shoot you all
And the day has been beautiful so far 
Yea the day has been beautiful so far

I want your skinny legs to be a phony 
False alarm I want your bony ass to drag itself 
Back to the farm I wamt the whiteness in your 
Cheeks to be replaced with red 
Then I want spiderman to spin a cobweb in your head
And the day has been beautiful so far
Yea the day has been beautiful so far

I'm here with you
Driving in your car
Yea the day has been beautiful so far
I want my frame to be much prettier
Than yours can be
I want the tigers to ignore you and then
Follow me
I want high heels put on my sneakers so that
You can see
That I will always be much happier more wild and free
And the day has been beautiful so far
Yea the day has been beautiful so far
I'm here with you
Driving in your car
Yea the day has been beautiful
So far
