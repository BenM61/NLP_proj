I say, I really really wanna
You think, I'm really really gonna
I'm an illusionist, throwing cards and doing tricks

The way is better where I'm going
Where the green grass growing
Call it imaginative, I say it's the greatest gift, cause

Oh, I move so naturally
Sway my hips so you can see
It's the only way to be
Now you've got to follow me

And I move move my head from left to right
Everybody, it's a benial sound
Awoo
Buckle up, and follow me

And I move my feet like one, two, three
Everybody in symmetry
Awoo
So buckle up, and follow me

And follow me
(A masterpiece, masterpiece)
And follow me, follow me
(It is a masterpiece)

You saved, and that was what we're given
I slayed, and that was how we're living
Oh yeah, I miss that good
Making gold, lotta wood

That world is giving me a hard time
I squeeze out a really good sound

Close your eyes for a colorful sight
Look inside, and you will find
The answers right inside your mind
