Ooh
We used to walk through fields of green 
We used to sit by clear blue streams 
We used to be so happy 
Me and you 

We used to do such silly things 
We used to make love in the rain 
We used to 
Yes, we used to 

Then you went away 
Leaving me with the memories we made 
Memories of those sweet yesterdays 
Spent with you (spent with you)
Spent with you 

And even though you're gone 
I still think so often of you 
And the things that we no longer do 
Like we used to (we used to)
Oh we used to 

We used to be so much in love 
We used to kiss and hold and touch 
We used to find so many things to do 

We used to laugh and plan and dream 
We used to own the world it seemed 
We used to 
Yes, we used to 

Then you went away 
Leaving me with the memories we made 
Memories of those sweet yesterdays 
Spent with you (spent with you)
Spent with you 

Oh and even though you're gone 
I still think so often of you 
And the things that we no longer do 
Like we used to 
Oh we used to 

La mmm
Ahh
