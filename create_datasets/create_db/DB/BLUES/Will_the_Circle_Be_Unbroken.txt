I was standing by my window,
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw an old hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, lord, in the sky

Undertaker, Mr. Undertaker
Will you please, drive your wagon slow
For thie lady, the one you're hauling
Lord, I hate to see here go

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, lord, in the sky
In the sky, lord, in the sky
