Step right up, come on in 
If you'd like to take the grand tour 
Of the lonely house that once was home sweet home 
I have nothing here to sell you 
Just some things that I will tell you 
Some things I know will chill you to the bone 
Over there, sits the chair 
Where she'd bring the paper to me sit down on my knee and whisper 
"Oh, I love you" 
But now she's gone forever 
And this old house will never 
Be the same without the love that we once knew 
Straight ahead, that's the bed, where we'd lie in love together 
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here 
See her picture on the table, don't it look like she'd be able 
Just to touch me and say "good morning dear" 
There's her ring, all her things, and her clothes are in the closet 
Where she left them when she tore my world apart 
As you leave you see the nursery, oh she left me without mercy 
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart 
Step right up, come on in, come on in
