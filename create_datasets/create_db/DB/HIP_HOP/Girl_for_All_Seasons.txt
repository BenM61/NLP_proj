It's hard to be a girl these days;
I'll tell you all the reasons.
Girl gotta look good in every season.
Just ask yourself this, girl, who are you pleasin',
Starin' in the mirror, squeezin' and tweezin'?
If I could turn back the hands of time
And have a dime for all the hateful thoughts in my mind,
Like "I can't do this" and "I can't wear that"
"Are my hips too big?" "Does my ass look fat?"
Might as well be superman, not a supermodel.
There ain't nothing you could buy in a fancy bottle
That'll ever let you love your own reflection.
Girl, close that magazine with your introspection.
'Cause you could feel good winter, spring, and fall
And when summer time comes, you gonna have it all.

I'll be your girl for all seasons.
I'll be your girl for all reasons,
Fulfilling all of your needs and
I'll be your girl for all pleasin'.

All the four seasons,
All of your needs, and
Stay with your man for all the wrong reasons.
All of your screamin', all of your demons.
Not enough time in the world for my healin'.

Girl, it's a setup and you're meant to fail.
You'd be better off on a live third rail
Just a few pass the skin test;
They don't care about the rest.
And yo, they mix lies into the cement.
We drink poison water and spend 'til we're spent
But youth it fades, crumbles, and ferments.
Eyelash curl, this is the first world
But vanity don't look good on the girl.
Oh, no, so when they line us up for roll call,
Let me make it clear on which side I fall.
'cause I'm a full grown woman, once a gifted child
And this is Northern State, not Girls Gone Wild!

I'll be your girl for all seasons.
I'll be your girl for all reasons,
Fulfilling all of your needs and
I'll be your girl for all pleasin'.

All the four seasons,
All of your needs, and
Stay with your man for all the wrong reasons.
All of your screamin', all of your demons.
Not enough time in the world for my healin'.

We can try and we can fall and we can fight to make it better.
We can try and we can fall and we can fight to make it better.
We can try and we can fall

I'll be your girl for all seasons.
I'll be your girl for all reasons,
Fulfilling all of your needs and
I'll be your girl for all pleasin'.

All the four seasons,
All of your needs, and
Stay with your man for all the wrong reasons.
All of your screamin', all of your demons.
Not enough time in the world for my healin'.

Clean up your mess and tired of stressin'.
Life and regrets and seeing you less.
I think I can leave by the end of the year.
Fight for your right to a life without fear.
