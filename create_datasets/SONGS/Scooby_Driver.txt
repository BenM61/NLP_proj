I'm coming over in the wrong direction
I only want to be the centre of your attention
For long enough to show you I'm worth the trouble that you take

I want to see the way that you portray
A boy who's going to try to change his life today ...

I want to see the way that you portray
A boy who maybe doesn't have too much to say
And you can draw your own conclusions
But you'll find I'm not a fake

You can turn away from me
But there's nothing that will keep me here you know
And you'll never be the city guy
And more than I'll be hosting The Scooby Show
