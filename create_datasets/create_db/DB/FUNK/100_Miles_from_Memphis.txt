(Scent of an angel)
Keeps me driving all night just to get to you
(Scent of an angel)
I keep your picture on my dash just to get me through

(Scent of an angel)
Reminds me of those crazy nights down in Mexico
(Scent of an angel)
Ah, temptation got a way of turning the lights down low

You're cool in your faded blue jeans
Just a fool in a tequila soaked dream
But you ain't no saint
You know I ain't no beauty queen

I was stuck in this border town
If we make it out before sundown
Baby let's slide on over
Over to the other side of the tracks

I got nothing behind me
Nothing left to remind me
Just a worn out picture
And a number written on the back

So let's move on down
Shake this town
Drive a while
A hundred miles from Memphis

A song playing in my head
Send me an angel
Move on up ahead
(Scent of an angel)

Sending a message
'Cause I feel a little cold and blue
(Scent of an angel)
Ah, expensive habit sure took one hold of you

Crawling in on a Sunday
And leaving town on Monday
There's a whole world waiting
Waiting on the other side of the line

I got nothing behind me
Nothing left to remind me
Just a worn out picture
A vision of you by my side

So let's head on down
Shake this town
Drive a while
A hundred miles from here

(Rolling, rolling)
(Somewhere back in town)
I'm stuck in a border town
If we make it out before sundown
Baby let's slide on over
Over to the other side of the tracks

I got nothing behind me
Nothing left to remind me
Just a worn out picture
And a number written on the back

So let's move on down
Get around, shake this town
Drive a while, go in style
A hundred miles from here

Here comes the morning
And here comes the morning
Here comes the morning
Here comes the morning
