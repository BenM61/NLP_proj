Alone together, beyond the crowd
Above the world, we're not too proud
To cling together, we're strong
As long as we're together

Alone together, the blinding rain
The starless night, were not in vain
For we're together and what is there
To fear together

Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If we're alone together
