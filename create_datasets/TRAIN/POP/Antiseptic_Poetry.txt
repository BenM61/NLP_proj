Is hate really negative, is love really positive?

It's not place to speak about emotion
Other side of my face, dealing with devotion
Who will want to know? Too hard to be personal
Who will want to know? Run the risk of losing all
Who will want to know? Where did I find this heart?
Who will want to know? Anesthetic jump-start

Is hate really negative, is love really positive?

Yeah, I can fell misplaced, red faced and nervous
But it's no disgrace, she uses super space-dust
Who will want to know? Lets me know I'm still a kid
Who will want to know? And it's okay to act like it
Who will want to know? Makes me happy for awhile
Who will want to know? Galactic movie-star smile

Is hate really negative, is love really positive?

No strong point, not my territory
No strong point, subject new to me
No strong point, heart stings, its a hit
No strong point and no anesthetic

Is hate really negative, is love really positive?
