Next time you see me, things won't be the same
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
And if it hurts you my darlin', you only got yourself to blame

Well it's a true true sayin', all that shines is not gold
Well it's a true true sayin', all that shines is not gold
and like the good book says you got to reap just what you sow

Well you lied, you cheated, oh-oh for so long
Well you lied, you cheated, oh-oh for so long
You're a wrong-doing woman and another girl has got your throne
