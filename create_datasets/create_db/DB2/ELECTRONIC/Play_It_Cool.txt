Oh you
Though I see you can't hide your tears
I don't want to live with all those fears
Guess I always have to be your fool
Better break it up and play it cool
Oh

There's something wrong
Something has gone
And your eyes are cold and lonely
Tears from no one
Sitting next to you
I feel the way you do
So is it any wonder
We realize the moon is turning blue

Sweet dreams in vain
But who's to blame
I remember love was easy
And forever
That was long ago
Oh, how was I to know
You took all my affection
And gave it to a dozen Romeos 

Oh you
Though I see you can't hide your tears
I don't want to live with all those fears
Guess I always have to be your fool
Better break it up and play it cool
Oh 

If you intend
To let it end
You don't need no explanations
No excuses
So look me in the eye
'Cause you don't have to lie
I wanna hear you tell me
That starting out again 's not worth a try

Oh you
Though I see you can't hide your tears
I don't want to live with all those fears
Guess I always have to be your fool
Better break it up and play it cool

Oh you
Though I see you can't hide your tears
I don't want to live with all those fears
Guess I always have to be your fool
Better break it up and play it cool
Oh
