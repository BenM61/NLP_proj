Boy, there's no one home tonight
The timing could be right
To forget the rules, we're out of school
Until tomorrow
Now, if only you would stay
There's so many games we'd play
Why should we pretend to be just friends
When we could be so much more?

Baby love, you are my
Baby love, just call it

Words don't mean so much to me
I'd rather wait and see
See what happens when the lights go down
With your arms around me
Time to leave the world behind
Save it for another time
Cause I don't remember where I am when
You start to love me

Baby love, you are my
Baby love, just call it
Ooh, baby, baby, love
Ooh, sweet and tasty baby, baby, love

Boy, I want you by my side
There's no reason we should hide
How we feel when we are near each other undercover
Warm, I'll hold you close to me
You're perfection first degree
Cause I don't remember where I am
When you start to move me

Baby love, you are my
Baby love, just call it
