I've got to leave old Durham town,
I've got to leave old Durham town.
I've got to leave old Durham town,
And the leavings gonna get me down.

Back in nineteen forty-four,
I remember Daddy walking out the door.
Mama told me he was going to war, he was leaving,
Leaving, leaving, leaving, leaving me. 

I've got to leave old Durham town,
I've got to leave old Durham town.
I've got to leave old Durham town,
And the leavings gonna get me down.

When I was a boy, I spent my time,
Sitting on the banks of the river Tyne.
Watching all the ships going down the line, they were leaving,
Leaving, leaving, leaving, leaving me.

I've got to leave old Durham town,
I've got to leave old Durham town.
I've got to leave old Durham town,
And the leavings gonna get me down.

The last week Mama passed away,
Good-bye, son, was all she'd say.
There's no cause for me to stay, so I'm leaving,
Leaving, leaving, leaving, leaving free.

I've got to leave old Durham town,
I've got to leave old Durham town.
I've got to leave old Durham town,
And the leavings gonna get me down.
