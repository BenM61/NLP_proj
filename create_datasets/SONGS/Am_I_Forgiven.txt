I lost my heart,
I didn't know what to do,
I was so caught in this misunderstanding,
Took it out all on you,
'Cause I didn't like the words,
I didn't like the words

I lost my heart,
I sat on my window and looked out and
Watched the rain washed down the street,
Oh will the sunrise,
Like the birds the birds that fly over,
Lies up to the trees

Oh will you be there for me,
Will you belong to me,
Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven

'Cause I didn't like the words,
I didn't like the words,
If I should let you go,
There would be nothin,
And finally,
Love would be,
And I can begin again,
Can we begin again

Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven

Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven

Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven

Am I forgiven,
Am I forgiven
