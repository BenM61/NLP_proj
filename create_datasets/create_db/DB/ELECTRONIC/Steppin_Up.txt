I light up like a genie then I blow up on this song
(Rub-a-dub-a-dub-dub ruba-duba-dub-a-dub)
Aladdin, no kidding, boy I need a rub
(Rub-a-dub-a-dub-dub ruba-duba-dub-dub)
Me and my speakers speakin' sub sub sub
(Suba-suba-sub-sub suba-suba-suba-sub)
You know who I am, I run this fucking club
(Club-a-dub-dub-dub club-a-dub-a-club-a-lub)

Bass lines and ass
Anything fast
Humpin' on my leg
Yo, mind my fuckin' glass
Making money, yes
Hide it in the bath
Sound of a bomb blast throw it in the bag

Bass lines and cars
Anything fast 
Know who I am
I run this fucking club
Speakers split the sub
Throwing fire like a mob
Flash, bang thunder demolition job?

(M.I.A.) you know who I am
(M.I.A.) you know who I am

Bass lines and ass
Anything fast
Humpin' on my leg
Yo, mind my fuckin' glass
Making money, yes
Hide it in the bath
Sound of a bomb blast throw it in the bag

I can make a sound, and the shriek will make you jump (jjjjump jjjjump jjjjjump)
I can smash your feet, and the track will make you run (run run run run run run run run)
Pulled up to tee I tie up just for fun (fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun)
Get ready for the set weights by the ton (ton ton ton ton ton ton ton)
