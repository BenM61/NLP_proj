Why you look so sad
When the sky is perfect blue
And you're getting everything
You ever wanted to
Let's not talk about the bad times
We've been through that before
It's not right
For making love anymore

Just stop your fussin' boy
Please stop your fussin' boy
For your time will come
Yes your time will come

Can you lay me down
In meadows soft and green
And can you lay me down
And talk to me of things
Like stars that burn into the night
And moons that turn with purple lines
That's what I want

Just stop your fussin' boy
Please stop your fussin' boy
Your time will come
Can't you just stop your fussin', boy
Please stop your fussin' boy

Can someone tell me why it is
How we could spend so many lonely years
When there's a light at the end of life
It's enough it's enough it's enough
 it's enough to try
We can see the light
We can feel the warmth
We can see it shine
We can see it all in our lifetime

So why you look so sad
When the sky is perfect blue
And you're getting everything
You ever wanted, too

Stop your fussin'
Just stop your fussin'
For your time will come
We can see it in our lifetime
We can see it in our lifetime
