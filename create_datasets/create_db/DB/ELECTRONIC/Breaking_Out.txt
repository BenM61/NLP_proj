She breathes a sigh, watching as her life goes by 
Caught in the trap of a workin'-day world 
Tired of just being somebody's girl 
She's feelin' her frustration buildin' up inside 
But tonight, she's gonna give it up 
Break the chains and let it out 
Tonight, she'll say "I've had enough" 
I'm never going back 

Breaking out, into the night 
Breaking out, she's taking flight 
Breaking out, out in the street 
Breaking out, gotta break free 

He counts the days, wishin' he could get away 
Stuck in the rut of an empty routine 
Nowhere to go with his hopes and his dreams 
Prepare himself for the moment of his great escape 
And tonight, he's gonna make his move 
Take a chance and risk it all 
Tonight, he's gonna cut it loose 
Never looking back 

Breaking out, into the night 
Breaking out, he's taking flight 
Breaking out, out in the street 
Breaking out, gotta break free 

There's gonna come a time when you just leave it all behind 
Burst out of your prison and just fly away 
Tonight, they're gonna make their move 
Take a chance and risk it all 
Tonight, they're gonna cut it loose 
Never looking back 

Breaking out, into the night 
Breaking out, they're taking flight 
Breaking out, out in the street 
Breaking out, gotta break free 

Breaking out, into the night 
Breaking out, they're taking flight 
Breaking out, out in the street 
Breaking out, gotta break free 
Breaking out, into the night 
Breaking out, they're taking flight 
Breaking out, out in the street 
Breaking out, gotta break free 
Breaking out, into the night 
Breaking out, they're ... (fade out)
