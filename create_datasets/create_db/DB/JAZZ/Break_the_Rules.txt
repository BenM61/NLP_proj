I corrupt
I erupt
I wonder how
I do it now

Wonder how do it now
I don't believe
I play for keeps
I play it cool

I break the rules
Play it cool break the rules
I play dead
I see red

I take what comes
I jump the gun
Take what comes jump thegun
I corrupt

I erupt
I wonder how
I do it now
Wonder how do it now

I don't believe
I play for keeps
O play it cool
I break the rules

Break the rules
