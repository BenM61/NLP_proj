Be nice but be wise (ah ah)
And don't let temptation control your pride (ooh's)
You can rule a throne a king has lost
Just remember the bridge that you took across

Be friends to everyone (ah ah)
And don't let faith go to your head (ooh's)
You can rule a throne a king has lost
Just remember the bridge that took you across

Bridge
Life, is what you make it (ah's)
You just can't be, you just can't be what you're not (ah's)
So don't pretend and at the end (ah's)
You will always come out on top whoa (ooh's)

I, I'm looking back (ah's)
At the mistakes I have made (ooh's)
You can rule a throne a king has lost
Just remember the bridge that took you across

Yes remember the bridge darling
That took you across, remember that bridge
