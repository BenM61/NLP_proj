From moment to moment
Every moment that I live
I live for every moment with you

To see you
To touch you
To imagine this will be
The moment when a dream comes true

Just an ordinary day becomes adventure
Such sweet adventure
I never knew

And life will be rainbows
As I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do
From moment to moment with you
