I don't know how it feels
Cause I don't live in your part of the world
I know it's not ideal
Oh but nothing is forever my girl

See, I'm a dreamer
Oh for love it is all in the name
I'm a believer
You may be far away, but you're thinking the same

I close my eyes and I picture us together
I hope you know
That I'll be waiting here for you, my love
On this New York City coast
I close my eyes and I picture us together
I hope you know
That I'll be waiting here for you, my love
On this New York City coast

Cause you're the real deal
You're worth every bit as much as you know
Delivered, signed and sealed
I'll get there girl, albeit it slow

And I'm a dreamer
Yeah for love it is all in the name
I'm a believer
You may be far away, but we're thinking the same

I close my eyes and I picture us together
I hope you know
That I'll be waiting here for you, my love
On this New York City coast
I close my eyes and I picture us together
I hope you know
That I'll be waiting here for you, my love
On this New York City coast

I'll be waiting here for you
I'll be waiting here for you
I'll be waiting here for you
I'll be waiting here for you

Oh and it might take all night
But we're only one flight
Away from each other
I'm coming for you, hold on tight

I close my eyes and I picture us together
I hope you know
That I'll be waiting here for you, my love
On this New York City coast
I close my eyes and I picture us together
I hope you know
That I'll be waiting here for you, my love
On this New York City coast

I'll be waiting here for you
I'll be waiting here for you
I'll be waiting here for you
I'll be waiting here for you
