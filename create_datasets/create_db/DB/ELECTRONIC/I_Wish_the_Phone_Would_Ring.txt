More than ever you're on my mind
Being lonely ought to be a crime
Watching TV to pass the time
When all I think about is you
And if you're thinking of me too
I know you know what to do

I wish the phone would ring
I'd do anything
Just to hear your voice
Oh Baby, why
Why do we have to fight
Can't we both be right
Wake me from this dream
I wish the phone would ring
Ring

What we're doing doesn't feel so right
And you should be here in my arms tonight
Here in my heart I live all alone
Locked up inside these lonely walls
Can't go anywhere at all
So afraid I'll miss your call

I wish the phone would ring
I'd do anything
Just to hear your voice
Oh Baby, why
Why do we have to fight
Can't we both be right
Wake me from this dream
I wish the phone would ring
Ring

All I do is think of you
And if you're thinking of me too
I know you know what to do

I wish the phone would ring
I'd do anything
Just to hear your voice
Oh Baby, why
Why do we have to fight
Can't we both be right
Wake me from this dream
I wish the phone would ring
Ring

I wish the phone would ring
I'd do anything
Just to hear your voice
Oh Baby, why
Why do we have to fight
Can't we both be right
Wake me from this dream
I wish the phone would ring
Ring

I wish the phone would ring
