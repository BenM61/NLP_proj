Feelin' low 
Rockin' slow
I want to go 
Right back where I belong 

Way down south in Birmingham 
I mean south in Alabam' 
There's an old place where people go 
To dance the night away 

They all drive or walk for miles 
To get jive that southern style 
It's an old jive that makes you want 
To dance till break of day 

It's a junction where the town folks meet 
At each function in a tux they greet you 

Come on down, forget your care 
Come on down, you'll find me there 
So long town, I'm heading for 
Tuxedo Junction now
