Well I'm all in, put it up on the board
Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared
1-2-3 down for the count
The result of my lyrics, oh yes, no doubt
Cold rock rap - 49er supreme
Is what I choose and I use - I never lose to a team
'Cause I can can go solo, like a Sugar Ray bolo
Make the fly girls wanna have my photo
Run in their room, hang it on the wall
In remembrance that I rocked them all
Suckers, ducks, ho-hum emcees
You can't rock the kid, so go cut some cheese
Take this application of rhymes like these
My rap's red hot, 110 degrees
So don't start bassin' cause I'll start placin'
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
You and you mind from a beatin' from my rhymes
A time, a crime that I can't find
I'll show you my gun, my Uzi weighs a ton
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

You got no rap, but you want a battle
It's like havin' a boat, but you got no paddle
'Cause I never pause, I say it because
I don't break in stores, but I break all laws
Written while sittin', all fittin' not bitten
Givin' me the juice that your not gettin'
I'm not a law obeyer, so you can tell your mayor
I'm a non-stop, rhythm rock poetry sayer
I'm the rhyme player, the the ozone layer
A battle what? Here's a bible so start your prayer
A word to the wise is justified
If they ask you what happened, just admit you lied
You just got caught a, for going out of order
And now you're servin' football teams their water
You just got dissed, all but dismissed
Sucker duck emcees, you get me pissed
It's no fun, being on the run
'Cause they got me, Public Enemy number one

For all you suckers, liars, your cheap amplifiers
You crossed up wires are always starting fires
For you grown up criers, now here's a pair of pliers
Get a job like your mother, I heard she fixes old dryers
You have no desires, your father fixes tires
You try to sell ya equipment, but you get no buyers
It's you they never hire, you're never on flyers
'Cause you and your crew, is only known as good triers
Known as the poetic lyrical son
I'm Public Enemy number one
