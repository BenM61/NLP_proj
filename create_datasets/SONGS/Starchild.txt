Gazing into Outer Space
My telescope sent me to another planet
Since I was a child I yearned
To wear the rings around Saturn
My fingers burned
But when you hold me baby
That's the only time
I'm content, element, so sublime

Don't it make you wonder that your universal lover
Could be wearing the same smile
Oh you are my Starchild
Baby beam me, baby beam me up up
Drink the milky, from the Milky Way cup
Hold me tighter, touch me, then do
All of the sweet things
That star lovers do

Visions of another time
A strong pyramid, where secrets of life hid
Ancient hieroglyphics told
Of one man touching like Midas
He turned my love to gold
And when you hold me baby and I wear your magic ring
I feel you like no one in this world I've seen

Don't it make you wonder that your universal lover
Could be wearing the same smile
Oh you are my Starchild
Baby beam me, baby beam me up up
Drink the milky, from the Milky Way cup
Hold me tighter, touch me, then do
All of the sweet things
That star lovers do

Take me to your heaven
I'll lay your odds to seven
And the stars up in the sky
I can see them in your eyes
Oh you are my Starchild
Starchild
Starchild
