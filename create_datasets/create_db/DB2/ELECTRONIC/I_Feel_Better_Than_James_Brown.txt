When we were in love I pretended you didn't exist
That way I loved you more
You suggested we get married and move into a house
I suggested that we jump overboard
And live underwater in the lost city of Atlantis
Where mermaids sing
And tuxedoed dolphins bring you breakfast

One year later I was transfered to the moon
Worse pay, better hours
I was transfered to the moon
Worse pay, better fellow workers

I built our love out of blood
I went to the dentist and told him "take out my heart"
I feel better than James Brown
I feel better now
I feel better than James Brown

I was attending Mardi Gras with Fidel Castro
Buxom cross dressers threw fake gold coins at our feet
As we discussed the fate of the revolution
Suddenly, CIA men dressed in bikinis
Tried to stab us with fountain pens
Fidel blew mustard gas from his cigar
And immobalized the lot of them
19 tequilas later we had a deal
Havana goes back to the mob
And Fidel and I open a chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken shops

Ain't life sweet? I feel good
I feel better than James Brown
I feel better now
I feel better than James Brown
I feel better now, how do you feel?

I feel better than James Brown
I feel better now
I feel better than James Brown
I feel better now
I feel better than James Brown
I feel better now, how do you feel?
