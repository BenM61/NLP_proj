Well I've had love before
I should have known what was goin' on
I can see why you have chosen to ignore me
My fault for being so cruel
I should have know
That you would hear about us
Well I don't know what I was thinkin' of
If you can find it in your heart to forgive me
I'll be waiting here for the two of us 
Cause it's not over till it's over
Till I'm over you
Cause it's not over till it's over
Till I'm over you

You know this love that we both once had
Was simply too good to be true
But I was tempted by another
And I abused you
I saw you standin' there
At the end of our street
And I remember how we used to live
If I could change your mind
Or turn back the hands of time
Well you'd be in my arms
In my arms
In my arms again

Cause it's not over till it's over
Till I'm over you
Cause it's not over till it's over
Till I'm over you
