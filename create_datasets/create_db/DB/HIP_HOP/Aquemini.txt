Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "why"
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

Now is the time to get on like Spike Lee said
Get on the bus go get your work
And keep your beeper chirpin' is a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch
Familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff
Provided to you by sack man
Pac man how in the f*ck do you think we gon' do that man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat man
I'm strapped man & ready to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times
And swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners
That we be bending in Volkswagens and Bonnevilles
Chevrolets and Coupe De Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain
Steering wheel for real you can go on chill out & still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fucking beeper bill bitch

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "why"
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

Twice upon a time there was a boy who died twice
And lived happily ever after but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors & baby bottles and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts
You know how to work bread cheese and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya sellin' what ya bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge now meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad need some hope
Like the words maybe, if, or probably more than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all I often drift I'm talkin' gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside it's grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed so what have you
Now question is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught in appearance
It's Outkast Aquemini another Black experience Okay

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "why"
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

The name is Big Boi Daddy Fat Sax
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
Cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that some say we pro-black boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme we bust back
Get get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear that can't come near that maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea yea yea yea

My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben. welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in wit' yo' kin
Look again 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happenin' again wish I could tell you when
Andre this is Andre y'all just gon' have to make amends

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "why"
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini
