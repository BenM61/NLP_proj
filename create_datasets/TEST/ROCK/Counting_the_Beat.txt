I look at the sunrise
I look at it earn
I look into your eyes
Don't know where to turn
I'm gonna drift into that void
I'm flying through space
I'm an asteroid
I'm dancing that place when you're paranoid
I'm thinking about you and nothing else
Think about you, you think about me
Think about you, counting the beat
Thinking about you, thinking about me
Thinking about just you and me
La-dah-da-de, there ain't no place I'd rather be
La-da-de-da, la-da-de-da, la-da-de-da...

I'm bleeding to death
On the cloudiest day
Three-four-five beat
A-waltzing away
I'm counting the beat, two-three-four-five
I'm feeling the heat, glad to be alive
I'm counting the beat, six-seven-eight-nine
I'm wishing that you, that you were mine
Think about you, you think about me
Think about you, counting the beat
Thinking about you, thinking about me
Thinking about you, thinking about me
Thinking about you ?
Think about, just you and me
La-dah-da-de, there ain't no place I'd rather be
La-da-de-da, la-da-de-da, la-da-de-da...
