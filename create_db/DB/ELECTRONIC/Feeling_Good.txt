Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me, yeah
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me, yeah
And I'm feeling good
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies are havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
And in this old world is a new world, and a bold world for me!

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine and I know how I feel

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
And I'm feeling good
