I'm counting stars
Lying under, watching you through my walls
All the lights have gone out
I know you're listening now
You've been spinning around, turning slowly
Orbiting round my house
And it's a feeling I get
I know you're listening now 

Warm me today, warm me today
Filter in my lonely room
Warm me today, warm me today
Look outside the sun it's bursting through, bursting through
Oh, it's filling up this room 

Now my fingers are cold
But I have touched you
You're all I need to know
Don't fade from me now
I know you're listening somehow 

All you can give, all you can give 
Twisting by its more than the light 
It's all you can give, all you can give
Look outside the sun is bursting through, bursting through
Oh, it's filling up this room
Warm me today, warm me today 
Look outside the sun it's bursting through, bursting through 
Oh, filling up this room
