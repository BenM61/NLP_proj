She keeps her patience for the bedroom 
Should satisfy her for a week 
Her domination is executed cheaply 
With her studio technique 
What's new? 
She carries love in a carrier bag 
What's new? 
She don't keep her body clean 
Oh, Oh, Oh 
Illegitimate contributions 
And neurotic fantasies conceived 

Love is infectious 
I don't know about that 
Love is infectious 
I don't know about it 

She keeps appointments by the hour glass 
Guerilla warfare in her bed 
And constant love is oh oh so negative 
We're simulating sex instead 
She carries love in a carrier bag 
She don't keep her body clean 
Oh, Oh, Oh 
Illegitimate contributions 
And neurotic fantasies conceived 

Love is infectious 
I don't know about that 
Love is infectious 
I don't know about it 

No personality's essential 
Nobody strictly in command 
She's not direct, elusive 
Or inadequate 
Love's incompatible commands 

What's new? 
She carries love in a carrier bag 
What's new? 
She don't keep her body clean 
Oh, Oh, Oh 
Illegitimate contributions 
And neurotic heartaches are conceived 

Love is infectious 
I don't know about that 
Love is infectious 
I don't know about it
