I'm going to ask your friends your number
And I'll call you when your man is out of town
And if I say the right words at the right time
Then perhaps you'll even have me 'round
And wouldn't it be a funny situation
The two of us and a comic conversation

How's the world been treating you you'd say
Trying not to get involved in any way
Have you been as fancy free 
As how you said you'd like to be
Comic Conversation will pass the time of day

When all the while I'm dying to reach out
And hold you in my arms the way I used to do
I cannot help thinking that you feel the same
But comic conversation rules the game

I'd like to spin a web 
And wrap you in its silver thread and 
Feel you sway
Oh-oh, but many years have passed 
And with them went the right I ever had to 
Feel this way
No-oh, there isn't going to be a happy ending
I think I should be going soon
I can't keep on pretending

How's the world been treating you you'd say
Trying not to get involved in any way
Oh have you been as fancy free 
As how you said you'd like to be
Comic Conversation will pass the time of day

When all the while I'm dying to reach out
And hold you in my arms the way I used to do
And I cannot help thinking that you feel the same
But comic conversation is the only way
