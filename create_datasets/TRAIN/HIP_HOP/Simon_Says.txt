Get the f*ck up
Simon says get the f*ck up
Throw your hands in the sky
(Bo bo bo bo bo)
Queens is in the back sipping 'gnac y'all what's up
Girls, rub on your titties
Yeah I said it, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

Y'all know the name
Pharoahe fucking Monch, ain't a damn thang changed
You all up in the Range and shit, inebriated
Strayed from your original plan, you deviated
I alleviated the pain with long-term goals
Took my underground loot, without the gold
You sold platinum round the world, I sold wood in the hood
But when I'm in the street and shit it's all good
I'm soon to motivate the room, control the game like Tomb Raider
Rock, clock dollars, flip tips like a waiter
Block shots, styles greater, let my lyrics anoint
If you holding up the wall, then you missing the point

Get the f*ck up
Simon Says get the f*ck up
Put your hands to the sky
(Bo bo bo bo bo)
Brooklyn in the back shooting craps now what's up
Girlies, rub on your titties
F*ck it, I said it, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

Yo, where you at, uptown let me see 'em
Notorious for the six-fives and the BM's
Heads give you beef, you put em in the mausoleum
And shit don't start pumping till after 12 pm
Uh, ignorant minds, I free 'em
If you tired of the same old everyday you will agree I'm
The most obligated, hard and R-Rated
Slated to be the best, I must confess the star made it
Some might even say this song is sexist-es
Cause I asked the girls to rub on their breast-eses
Whether you're riding the train or a Lexus-es
This is for either or Rolies or Timex-eses
Wicked like Exorcist, this is the joint
You holding up the wall then you missing the point

Get the f*ck up
Simon Says get the f*ck up
Throw your hands in the sky
(Bo bo bo bo bo)
The Bronx is in the back shooting craps now what's up
Girls rub on your titties
I said, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

New Jeru, get the f*ck up
Shaolin, get the f*ck up
Long Isle, get the f*ck up
Worldwide, get the f*ck up
