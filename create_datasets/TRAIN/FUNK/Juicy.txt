(Hook)
Hit em off wit a little bit (oh)
Came back wit a little bit (wee)
Got the hot boy all afta me (y)
That J-you-I-see-why That J-you-I-see-why

(Casha D)
Late night or the morning time
It's on his mind
(that's the way that juicy got em)
Before he met me he was doin wrong
Till I did him right
(that's the way that juicy got em)
He used to run his game 
Juicy made him change
Now he's buyin rings
(that's the way that juicy got em)
He was holdin down them streets
Now he's holdin me
'cause I got what he needs
(that's the way that juicy got em)

(chourus)
He leaving other chicks
'cause he's hooked on this
And it ain't my kiss
(that's the way that juicy got em)
Got him up all night 
Give him what he like
Got him actin right
(that's the way that juicy got em)
'cause I got what he want
He's blowin up my phone
He won't leave me alone
(that's the way that juicy got em X3)

(Casha D)
I never have to ask him who is she
That's how it's posed to be
(that's the way that juicy got em)
Now he say he wanna take me home
Meet his family
(that's the way that juicy got em)
Said he'd never settle down
Juciy kept him round
Bet he don't know how
(that's the way that juicy got em)
He was holdin down them streets
Now he's holdin me
'cause I got what he needs
(that's the way that juicy got em)


(Loui-V)
I'm in the drivas seat 
He takin my direction
The juicy got him goin 
Callin home every second
How was the boy to know 
He ain't seen nothin like it
I seen it from the jump
And I ain't no Cleo the psychic
He thought he was a mac 
Runnin game ta all the girls
Told him I'm the flyest chick
Up in this F***in world
He laughed it off so I gave him some help
And let the J.U.I.C.Y 
Go and speak for it's self

(OC)
Yeah
Tha juicy bout to get him like a dope feind
He's hittin it hittin it choking
There's no way to stop I'm grindin
Got him twisted
Never kno the competition from them strippin hoes
Dat be workin all night on dem poles
Tryin get attention
Got the juice 
Double choclate like a piston
Hit it off set it off like a pop gun
I ain't gotta front 'cause I got one 
And I'm hot son
Wit a ... that be makin niggas come back
It's gon get you too If only you knew
What this juicy gon do to you
Mas caliente que me sude como nd barbque
J.U.I.C.Y I got em
Get up like
Yeah that's how I got em

(Hook)
