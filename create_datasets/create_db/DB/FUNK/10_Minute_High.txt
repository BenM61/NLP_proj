She
She doesn't need it but she won't try
Try to release it
Cause she thinks she'll die
Depending on it for it she'll lie
It's only a 10 minute high
Eyes
That witnessed a father beat on a mother
Witnessed a system take away her only brother
No one ever said that they loved her
She used to shut her eyes and make the pain subside
But now she's got her 

10 minute high
Just for a little while
She's queen of all the skies
If a hid is bad another one she can buy
Everybody tells her to stop
She would try
But nobody gave her a good reason why

Time has taken it's toll
She looks too old for seventeen
The girl is much too bold
Her heart is cold
When it used to be of gold
Her future has no chance to unfold
She's used her body to get her ways
Is she ashamed of the games she's played
But her best defense is to block out all the pain
But first she buys her

10 minute high
Just for a little while she's floating through the sky
What's she gonna do when she no longer can fly
Is she gonna land on her feet or come down to die
Or is she gonna just break down and cry

When she comes down it all becomes too clear
She knows that someday she should face her fears
But with a touch of reality and over the years
She's forgotten how it feels to be real
It's early morning quiet is the street
She lays in silence the cold cement beneath her feet
She passed away and today's her eighteenth birthday
And all she's left me to say is

She just had her last 10 minute high
Did she contemplate that it would take away her life
She probably knew but she had no reason to fight
There is not a breath on her lips not even a sigh
If only she had known wrong from right
If only she had known
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, girl
Goodbye, bye
