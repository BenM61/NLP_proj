Sometimes I'm simple minded
Then I can't read your look
All my thoughts are binded
I'm like an opened book
In which you read the story
Of a bleeding soul I am so sorry
Each time I lose control

I should suppress my rage
I need you beside me
Don't you leave the stage
I need you to guide me
I know you'll be my savior
If I repeat my fault
If I repeat my fault
You put me on my best behavior
You hear my call

Please hold out
I regret
All the nasty words I said
I can feel you getting colder
Please don't doubt
That I regret
All the days I left you sad
Can't you see me getting older

I know I hurt your feelings
But you had the strength
To start my healing
You went all lengths
The days of crying
Have reached the end
'Cause now I'm trying
To understand

Please hold out
