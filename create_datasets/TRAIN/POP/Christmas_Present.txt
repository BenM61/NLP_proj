Boxes stacked up to the ceiling
All wrapped up in Christmas feeling
Golden bells caress the mistletoe

The colors glow, red, silver, green and blue
And this I know, this rainbow came 
From you trimmed with dew
Though my heart is overflowing
Loving all the love you're showing

What I'd value most would be your call
To tell me when you'll be home in my arms again
The loveliest Christmas present of them all

What I'd value most would be your call
To tell me when you'll be home in my arms again
The loveliest Christmas present of them all
