Hey, there shawty you looking kinda good
Put ya' Gucci frames on girl represent ya' hood
Hey, how you doing? You kinda cute too
Smelling like cool water in, yo' pinacle boots

See I get my hair cut and I get my nails done
Everybody know my name and baby, where I'm from
See they treat me like the Mayor
Some say that I'm a player, I'm a high noon tycoon, sexy lady slayer

Damn, dude, please, I'm all about the cheese
You push it old school I dangle Mercedes keys
Ya' bad credit having ass need to be ashamed
With everything in, yo' mama name everybody know

Now I'ma tell the truth we ain't got to fuss
I don't own a car, pimping ride the bus
But you looking mighty good, yea, I'm kinda hot
Girl, we can get it on, boy, go an do da wop

Wop wid it, wop da, wop wit it
Wop wid it, wop da, wop wit it
Bang, bang, bang, bang, ba, bang, oh
Bang, bang, bang, bang, ba, bang, oh

Work sum, twurk sum, get it girls
Work sum, twurk sum, get it girls
Rock wit it and look back at it
I said, roll wit it and look back at it, see'ommon

You say, you doing good but you could be better
Roll with a pimp number one trend setter
Ya, man is a cream puff, boy, you don't know him
Well, do he buy you nice stuff? Shut up, he's still growing

Enough about him, let's talk about us
Take ya, time Shawty, baby, I ain't in a rush
Slow motion with it if ya let me hit it
I get ya right every night put the ocean in it

I got a posture-pedic, heart-shaped water bed
Sheet might be satin and the pillows look suede
Yea, girl I know how to getcha, I got a 54 inch flat screen picture of me
Standing by a tree with some kackhi dickies on in a white tee
And I like the way you move, I like the way you step
We could get it going, we go and do the prep

Prep wit it, prep da, prep wit it, prep wit it
Prep wit it, right to left wit it, prep wit it
Go an' break it down show 'em what you working with
Go an' break it down shake it like a earthquake

Smurf wit it, smurf da, smurf wit it, jerk wit it
Smurf wit it, smurf da, smurf wit it [Inaudible]
Now do the soul clap, now do the soul clap
Now do the soul clap, now do the soul clap

The club is packed, the night is young
For real baby girl, I'm trying to make you the one
You're the one, one, one, one, one
Put ya' finger in it and you having fun girl, well, I

Been looking at you from across the spot
My legs start shaking and my body get hot
Hey, I need relations can't fight the temptations
Well, this just conversation ain't gon' be no penetration

Now wait a minute, hold up baby, get it straight
I ain't gotta be yo' man, we don't even gotta date
But we almost at the end of the song
The club 'bout to close let a player bring you home

Shawty drop it like its hot, pick it up and make it pop
Now go down to the floor take ya' time work it slow
Keep it right there daddy I'ma bounce that
When you want it, how you want it, make it bounce back

Come on and back it up, back to, back it up, oh
Back it up, back to, back it up, oh
Come on rock wit it and look back at it
I said, roll wit it and look back at it, c'mon

Now slide and do the waterfall
Now slide and let the rain come down
Slide and do the waterfall
Now slide and let the rain come down

Get some, get some, get some
Get some, get some, get some
Now tighten up wit it, tighten up wit it
Tighten up wit it, tighten up, tighten up

Wam da, wam da, wam, wam da, wam, oh
Wam da, wam da, wam, wam da, wam, oh

Man I'm tired I don't even
Do da running man, I do da running man
I do da running man, I do da running man

Now, do da bunny hop, I do da bunny hop
I do da bunny hop, I do da bunny hop
Now, do da bunny hop, now everybody freeze
