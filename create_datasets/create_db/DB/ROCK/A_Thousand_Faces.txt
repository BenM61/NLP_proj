I stand surrounded by the walls that once confined me
Knowing I'll be underneath them
When they crumble when they fall
With clarity my scars remind me
Ash still simmers just under my skin

Indifference smile again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?

Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me which is you

Eerily time made no change
Pointing fingers, laying blame
Lying over and over and over and over
Deceiving your mind
Dug my grace, trash my name
Yet here I stand so you won't fade away

A different smile again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward

Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you

I bleed inside
(Wanna bleed)
Just let it out
(You gotta let it out)
Just let it out
(Gotta let it out)
I bleed inside
(Wanna Bleed Inside)
Just let it out
(You gotta let it out)
Just let it out
Just let it die

Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me, tell me, tell me
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me, tell me which is you
