Tryin' to find a woman that wants to grow old with me
Tryin' to find a woman that wants to grow old with me
Because I wanna settle down and try to raise a family

Kinda in a hurry 'cause time is passing by
Yes, kinda in a hurry 'cause time is passing by
If I don't get a woman soon I'll be too old to try

I want a woman who would listen and try to use her head
And don't start snowing in my ears, time she hit the bed
She don't have to be an angel but I sure don't want a square
I want a woman wise enough to wanna get some wealth

Cause I tryin' to find a woman that wants to grow old with me
Because I wanna settle down and try to raise a family
