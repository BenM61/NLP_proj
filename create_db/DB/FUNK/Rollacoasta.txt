It's fashion
It's fashion
It's fashion
It's strobe light, it's fashion, it's strobe light
It's rollacoasta!

Slap me in my face, punch me in the eye.
Do me how you want baby but just don't say goodbye
Tell me I'm no good, tell me I'm not right
Just let me lay beside you when you fall asleep tonight

Rollacoasta
Throw your hands up
Take me to the top
Rollacoasta
Up side down I never wanna stop
Rollacoasta
Take me to the limit til I drop
Rollacoasta make you scream (make you scream alright)
Make you scream, make you scream

Take me back, take me back
One more time around the track
One more time just hold me tight let me ride with you tonight
Here we go round and round twist and turn and heaven bound
One more time around the track
Tell me that you know
Tell me that you know

It's fashion it's strobe lights
It's rollacoasta

Hate me in the morning
Sex me up at noon
Girl have me for dinner, baby tease me with your food
Get mad at me for drinkin' shout at me to stop
But you know I'm the only one that ever hits your spot

Rollacoasta
Trow your hands up
Take me to the top
Rollacoasta
Up side down I never wanna stop
Rollacoasta
Take me to the limit til I drop
Rollacoasta make you scream (make you scream now)
Make you scream, make you scream

Take me back, take me back
One more time around the track
One more time just hold me tight let me ride with you tonight
Here we go round and round twist and turn I'm heaven bound
One more time around the track
Tell me that you know
Tell me that you know

It's fashion it's strobelights
It's rollacoasta

One more time
One more time

It's fashion

Take me to the edges one more time
I'll come right down again
It's fashion
Take me on a ride boy if you dare
You know I'm going in

Rollacoasta make you scream, make you scream

Rollacoasta
Throw your hands up
Take me to the top
Rollacoasta
Up side down I never wanna stop
Rollacoasta
Take me to the limit till I drop
Rollacoasta make you scream (make you scream alright)
Make you scream, make you scream

Take me back, take me back
One more time around the track
One more time just hold me tight let me ride with you tonight
Here we go round and round twist and turn I'm heaven bound
One more time around the track
Tell me that you know
Tell me that you know

It's fashion it's strobelights it's rollacoasta
It's fashion it's strobelights it's rollacoasta
It's fashion, it's strobelights, it's

Rollacoasta make you scream, make you scream
Rollacoasta make you scream, make you scream
Rollacoasta make you scream, make you scream
