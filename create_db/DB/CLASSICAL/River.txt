It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
Putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
Yeah, but it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
You want to make a lot of money and split this crazy scene
I wish I had a river and I could skate away on

Oh, I wish I had a river so high
I could teach my feet to fly away, yeah
I wish I had a river, I could skate away on

But I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
And I think, your's the only best baby that I ever had
Oh, I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
She tried hard to help me, tried to put me at ease
She loved me so naughty, made me weak in my knees
Yeah, I wish I had a river, I could skate away on

Oh, I wish I had a river so high
I could teach my feet to fly away, yeah
I wish I had a river, I could skate away on

And I made baby cry, and I made my baby say goodbye
And I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
I could skate away on, I could skate away on
