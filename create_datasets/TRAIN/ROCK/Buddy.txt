Tell somebody they're your buddy
Get another body and they're your buddy too
Loosen up a little 
You fuddy duddy

Let's get silly just like the putty
Body to body 
You make a baby

Givin' it to grandpa make him crazy
Hey there buddy let's get some coffee
Are you doin' alright
Are feelin' awfully
Let's rock

Hey little buddy ain't life crazy
Dealin' with these people so shady 
Tell you that it's alright you're feelin' lazy
Hey little buddy you got a buddy
