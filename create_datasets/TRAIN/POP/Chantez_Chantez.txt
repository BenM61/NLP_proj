Chantez, Chantez, sing a little Paris song.
Chantez, Chantez, ev'rybody sing along.
Let's all sing when any little thing goes wrong,
Toodle oodle ay, toodle oodle oo.
Sing with me, merci beaucoup.
Toodle oodle oo, toodle oodle ay.
Ev'ryone Chantez.

(verse)
Were you on the wrong side of the bed when you arose?
Did a leaky fountain pen redecorate your clothes?
Did you have a snack at night which didn't quite agree?
Let's do what they do, the people of Paree.

Chantez, Chantez, sing a little Paris song.
Chantez, Chantez, ev'rybody sing along.
Let's all sing when any little thing goes wrong,
Toodle oodle ay, toodle oodle oo.
Sing with me, merci beaucoup.
Toodle oodle oo, toodle oodle ay.
Ev'ryone Chantez.
