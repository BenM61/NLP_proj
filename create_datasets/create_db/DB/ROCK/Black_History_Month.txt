Can you remember a time when this city was
A great place for architects and dilettantes
A nice place for mid waves and crossing guards
And on, and on

Hold on children
Your mother and father are leaving

Do you remember a time when this pool was
A great place for water wings and cannonballs
A nice place for astrologists and blow up dolls
And on, and on

Hold on children
Your best friend's parents are leaving
