I got it all worked out let settle now
But then you poke around for a better plan
Its not an easy street give it, give it all tonight
I'm such a mess right now, such a mess right now
You better show me how I'm not the simple kind
Its not an easy street give it give it all alright
You go OH, s-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one for you
Sh-sh-shake it while your at it now, like you mean it now
Gimme once gimme twice alright
I said to live this life, said to live this life
It takes a hell lot time making peace at night
Its not an easy street I shouldn't even bother now
I want less in life simply stroke some town
You better sip through all your fancy wine
And come alive once more
Oh but this time I decide
You go Oh s-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one for you
Sh-sh-shake it while your at it now, like you mean it now
Gimme once gimme twice tonight
I just wanna lay down come on lay down
Ill just go down baby stay high
I just wanna go down so wont you lay down now
Its time to go but I love you so GET OUT!
Oh s-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one for you
S-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one for you
Sh-sh-shake it while your at it now, like you mean it now
Gimme once gimme twice tonight.
