If you're looking for somewhere to go
Thought I'd take you to a movie show 
Sittin' in the back and I'll jack you off
I can't give you everything you want
But I can take you to a restaurant
If you're not hungry
I'll jack you off

If your man ain't no good
Come on over to my neighborhood
We can jump in the sack and I'll jack you off

If you're tired of the masturbater
Little girl, we can go on a date
And if you like, I'll jack you off

I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off

I only do it for a worthy cause
Virginity or menopause, you'll have
an instant heart attack if I jack you off

If you really really want to be a star
We gotta do it in your momma's car
Naked in a cadillac, I'll jack you off

If we can't find no place to go
Girl, I'll take you to a movie show, we can sit in the back
And I'll jack you off

I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I'll jack you off

? Alright say, we'll put some funk on here
I'll jack you off

If you ain't chicken baby, come here
If you're good I'll even let you steer
As a matter of fact, you can jack me off
Yeah, that's right

I'll jack you off, yeah
I'll jack you off
