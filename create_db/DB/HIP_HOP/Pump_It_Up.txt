Look, pump it up if you came to get it krunk
With a dame and shit that's drunk
You came to get it on, more than 5 O's in your bank
Then get it on, roll up like that stank
And get it on, slank that fitted on
Came to get it on
Hold up she want work that twork that
Then again let me hurt that murk that
Til you gotta hurt back
Can't spit it out, boo you gotta slurp that
Can't cuddle after we done, it wasn't worth that

But I'm only dealing with freaks that want to cut

They want to ride in something were the rims don't stop
Look baby you fine, but your girlfriends not
And then she want to hold out getting cute on the phone
I ain't gotta be bothered, be cute on your own
My jump off doesn't run off at the mouth so much
My jump off never ask why I go out so much
My jump off never has me going out of my way
And she don't want nothing on Valentines Day
My jump off don't argue or get rebellious
And she don't mind hanging out wit da fellas
My jump off's not insecure or jealous
(Uuh, uuh, uuh)
