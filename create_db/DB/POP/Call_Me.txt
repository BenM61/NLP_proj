Face to face 
My reflection in your eyes 
I was scared to say too much 
Perfect strangers in perfect worlds apart 
Almost close enough to touch 
Staring at my shoes 
Feeling so confused 
Shot down without a gun 
Victim of a hit and run 
Won't you... 

Call me - call me 
No time to hesitate - we must communicate 
Call me - call me 
Won't you call this number nowwwww 

Mesmerised 
I go back to where we met 

A reconstruction of the crime 
I can't track you down 
Nowhere to be found 
Now my one shot at success 
Is the power of the press 
Won't you... 

Call me - call me 
No time to hesitate - we must communicate 
Call me - call me 
Won't you call this number nowwwww

Worlds apart - we are worlds apart 

Watch this space 
There's a message here for you 
No need to read between the lines 
I am inside out 
There can be no doubt 
I want you and no-one else 
Please identify yourself 

Call me - call me 
No time to hesitate - we must communicate 
Call me - call me 
Won't you call this number nowwww
