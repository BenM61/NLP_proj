I could be the next to see 
That there'll be nobody there 
If you feel excited throw your hands into the air 
No one can judge you baby 
That don't live your life 
I need the resistance 
Held by your astrological sign 
Now I'm caught in the middle 
You're next to me 
I swim with the fishes 
You come from the sea 
The dolphins were monkeys that didn't like the land 

Should I be walking the beach 
Then I'd be holding your hand 
I could be the next to see 
That there'll be nobody there 
If you feel excited throw your hands into the air 
No one can judge you baby 
That don't live your life 
I need the resistance 
Held by your astrological sign 
So now I'm caught in the middle 
You're next to me 
No one alive can lock the door to your dreams 
Caught in the middle 
Next to me 

I swim with the fishes 
You come from the sea 
The dolphins were monkeys 
That didn't like the land 
Should I be walking the beach 
I'll be holding your hand 
If you feel excited throw your hands into the air 
If you feel excited 
Throw your hands into the air 
No one can judge you baby 
That don't live your life 
I need the resistance 
Held by your astrological sign
