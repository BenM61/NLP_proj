The clock will tick away the hours 
One by one,
Then the time will come 
When all the waiting's done,
The time when you return 
And find me here and run.

If it takes forever
I will wait for you,
For a thousand summers
I will wait for you,
Till you're here back,
Back beside me, 
Till I'm holding you,
Till I hear you sigh
Here in my arms.

Anywhere you wander, 
Anywhere you go,
Every day remember 
How I love you so,
In your heart believe
What in my heart I know,
That forevermore,
I'll wait for you.
