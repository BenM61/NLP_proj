She say I'mma dog, but it takes one to know one, alright
And I can go for hours, ain't believe me, had to show one, alright
See I prefer the floor, not the bed
Fienin' for me, I can get it wet
She say I'mma dog, but it takes one to know one, alright

Let me see you drop it, throw it back
I'm 'bout to pin you to the carpet
Like it slow, you goin' fast
I'm 'bout to make you get up off it
Couple bald head hoes, lotta long weave
Got a tall red head ho, swear she want weave
Shawty need some transportation, but she can't afford it
How 'bout you ride this dick to work, but just watch where you goin'
Take my time grippin' on her waist line
Started this at night now it's approachin' daylight

She say I'mma dog, but it takes one to know one, alright
And I can go for hours, ain't believe me, had to show one, alright
See I prefer the floor, not the bed
Fienin' for me, I can get it wet
She say I'mma dog, but it takes one to know one, alright

Don't nobody else compare the way that Gates do you
Pull your hair, smack your ass, knock your break shoes loose
Other lames take you out shoppin', dinner, and a movie
Suck your titty in the mirror with a finger in your booty
Top drop in a foreign, blowin' smoke up in to heaven
My hand on your inner thigh, gently I'm caressin'
Say it make your pussy moist every time the engine revin'
Gettin' dressed inside designer stores, you know how we be steppin'

She say I'mma dog, but it takes one to know one, alright
And I can go for hours, ain't believe me, had to show one, alright
See I prefer the floor, not the bed
Fienin' for me, I can get it wet
She say I'mma dog, but it takes one to know one, alright

Don't get hard before it's over
Don't say I didn't warn ya
I can't even lie girl, you the truth
Bedroom or the sofa, your legs around my shoulder
My attention, giving all of it to you
