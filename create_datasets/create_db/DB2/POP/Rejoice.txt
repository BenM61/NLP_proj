Where did I misplace my faith
Where did I set it down
Which one the day that I forgot
What this was all about
And I came so close
To throwing it all away
But I'm taking it back again

So come and rejoice
Come and rejoice
What was lost is found

When did I get so sensible
Make me a fool again
My life was a half empty glass
Now it is full again
And this road we take
Is never an easy place
But somehow we've found our way

So come and rejoice
Come and rejoice
And you don't even have to make a sound
I feel it in your touch
You sing it with you eyes
What was lost is found

So come and rejoice
Come and rejoice
What was lost is what was lost is
What was lost is found
What was lost is found
