So let's pretend that we have no weight on our shoulders
No time for future, no time for the past
You know we're young, have time for fun
We'll open the door and out we run

I remember 'cause you told me you were going away
I wanted to know you, tomorrow was too late
Standing on younger ground, we didn't know what we'd found
But the world put you in front of me and we aligned

We stayed up all night (to watch the sunrise)
We stayed up all night (we never felt so alive)
We stayed up all night (to watch the sunrise)
We stayed up all night (we never felt so alive)

I remember the evening, the air was cold outside
I was wanting for nothing, somehow you arrived
Standing on younger ground, we didn't know what we'd found
The world put you in front of me and we aligned

We stayed up all night (to watch the sunrise)
We stayed up all night (we never felt so alive)
We stayed up all night (to watch the sunrise)
We stayed up all night (we never felt so alive)

I won't give it up tonight
I won't give it up tonight
I won't give it up tonight
I won't give it up tonight

We stayed up all night (to watch the sunrise)
We stayed up all night (we never felt so alive)
We stayed up all night (to watch the sunrise)
We stayed up all night (we never felt so alive)

We stayed up all night
We stayed up all night
We stayed up all night
We stayed up all night
