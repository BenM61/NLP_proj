Red and orange, or red and yellow
In which of these do you believe?
If you're not sure right now,
Please take a moment
I need your signature before you leave

When I sleep, I'm usually dreaming
But more and more, there's only one
Where every hired gun I've ever fired
Is making love to you while I look on

All fallen leaves should curse their branches
For not letting them decide where they should fall
And not letting them refuse to fall at all

Digging up the root of my confusion
If no one planted it, how does it grow?
And why are some hell bent upon there being an answer
While some are quite content to answer "I don't know"

All fallen leaves should curse their branches
For not letting them decide where they should fall
And not letting them refuse to fall at all
