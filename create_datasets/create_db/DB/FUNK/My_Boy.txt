I'm his lover not his mother 
Why you starin' at each other? 
What's your problem? 

I'm not his keeper, 
I'm his teacher 
Ho, 'n it goes deeper 
What's your problem? 

I can't control, these feelings I have inside 
I had to let go, let go of my pride 
Age is a number 
Don't steal my thunder 
Can't love no other, other, other 

You're my boy, 
Keepin' you inside so they don't see that you're my boy 
Keepin' you inside so they don't see that you're my boy 
Keepin' you inside so they don't see that you're my boy 
My boy, my boy! 

Where's the blame, where's the shame? 
We're just two hearts come together 
What's your problem? 

He's not a boy, not a toy 
He's man enough to understand 
What's your problem? 

I can't control these feelings I have inside 
I had to let go, let go of my prize 
Age is a number 
Don't steal my thunder 
I can't love no other, other, other 

You're my boy, 
Keepin' you inside so they don't see that you're my boy 
Keepin' you inside so they don't see that you're my boy 
Keepin' you inside so they don't see that you're my boy 
My boy, my boy! 

Don't mind tellin' you baby, she says he's my boy 
Don't mind tellin' you baby, she says he's my boy 
Don't mind tellin' you baby, she says he's my boy 
Don't mind tellin' you baby, she says he's my boy 
My boy, my boy

Yes, you're my boy, 
Keepin' you inside so they don't see that you're my boy 
Keepin' you inside so they don't see that you're my boy 
Keepin' you inside so they don't see that you're my boy 
My boy, my boy!
