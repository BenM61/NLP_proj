They try their best just to mash up the resistance
Warning shots and sirens from a distance
Riot gears and barricade for an instance
And the words from mi mouth, mi no response

Hollywood sending signals of destruction
Stereotype the ghetto youths as the bad man
Overcome the rough times and we grow strong
Step up in a life, now them want to shake we hand

We are eternal, made of the creator
Won't fall to the soul-less devastator
Divide and conquer, and try to separate us
Up to this day, them still tryin' to rape us
