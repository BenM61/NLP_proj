Who says I can't get stoned
Turn off the lights and the telephone
Me in my house alone
Who says I can't get stoned

Who says I can't be free
From all of the things that I used to be
Rewrite my history
Who says I can't be free

It's been a long night in New York city
It's been a long night in Baton Rouge
I don't remember you looking any better
But then again I don't remember you

Who says I can't get stoned
Call up a girl that I used to know
Fake love for an hour or so
Who says I can't get stoned

Who says I can't take time
Meet all the girls in the county line
Wait on fate to send a sign
Who says I can't take time

It's been a long night in New York city
It's been a long night in Austin too
I don't remember you looking any better
But then again I don't remember you

Who says I can't get stoned
Plan a trip to Japan alone
Doesn't matter if I even go
Who says I can't get stoned

It's been a long night in New York city
It's been a long time since 22
I don't remember you looking any better
But then again I don't remember, don't remember you
