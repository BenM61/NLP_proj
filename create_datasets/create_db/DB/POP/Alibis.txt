It's nothin' I can put my finger on
But it's there, I swear.
It's not somethin' I'm imaginin'
Each time you call,
I know I'll get your "working late" routine again
Is there someone I should know about?
Tell me why do I have this doubt?

I'm sure your alibis are watertight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Whoa, oh, but I know you're slippin' away from me

I'm sure your alibis are watertight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Whoa, oh, but I know you're slippin' away from me
I'm know your alibis are watertight
And you're where you say you are tonight
But honey, I can tell  
I know the pattern much too well
I don't fool so easily
Slippin' away from me

Your telephone service says you're out again.
Somewhere, out there, you've got another rendezvous
I know the way you work
You'll be someplace where no one can check up on you
You think you're in the clear but don't forget
That's exactly the way we met

I'm sure your alibis are watertight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Whoa, oh, but I know you're slippin' away from me

I'm sure your alibis are watertight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Whoa, oh, but I know you're slippin' away from me

Is there someone I should know about?

I'm sure your alibis are watertight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Whoa, oh, but I know you're slippin' away from me

I'm sure your alibis are watertight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Whoa, oh, but I know you're slippin' away from me
