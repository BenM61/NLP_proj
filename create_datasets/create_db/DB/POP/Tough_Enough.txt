Baby only the strong would survive 
Over mysteries of life 
Only fantasy keeps you away 
In the 
Lonely fields of those broken shields 

So keep on kicking 
The bomb is ticking 
Don't 
Stop, don't be a runaway 
Go for the fire 
Baby are you tough enough 
Just keep on living 
And 
Don't start giving 
The devil good reasons 
To get you in the seasons of heartbreak 
Baby are 
You tough enough 

(Baby are you tough enough) 
Yeah my skin is a dangerous place 
Never trust 
My smiling face 
With a touch I can change all your dreams 
And my kiss can wake feelings you can't 
Take 

So keep on kicking 
The bomb is ticking 
Don't 
Stop, don't be a runaway 
Go for the fire 
Baby are you tough enough 
Just keep on living 
And 
Don't start giving 
The devil good reasons 
To get you in the seasons of heartbreak 
Baby are 
You tough enough 

(Baby are you tough enough) 
(Baby are you tough enough) 

I 
Will meet you there 
'Cause I need you there 
Oh tonight 

So keep on kicking 
The bomb is ticking 
Don't 
Stop, don't be a runaway 
Go for the fire 
Baby are you tough enough 
Just keep on living 
And 
Don't start giving 
The devil good reasons 
To get you in the seasons of heartbreak 
Baby are 
You tough enough 

(Baby are you tough enough) 
(Baby are you tough enough) 

So keep on kicking 
The bomb is ticking 
Don't 
Stop, don't be a runaway 
Go for the fire 
Baby are you tough enough 
Just keep on living 
And 
Don't start giving 
The devil good reasons 
To get you in the seasons of heartbreak 
Baby are 
You tough enough 

Baby are you tough enough
