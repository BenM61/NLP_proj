You tried your best to show me 
That you really cared 
Said if there were days I was lonely 
Just call you - you'd be there 

You tried your best convinced me 
That you understand 
And if I need someone to hold on to 
You wanted to be the man 

Then I knew it was true 
All the feelings that I had inside for you 
I could not deny 
Though many times I tried 

Give me a little more time 
I need to make up my mind 
'cause you know I'm in two minds 
I want to be more than your friend 
Ooh I just can't pretend any longer 
Feelings getting stronger 

Give me a little more time

You've been there when I've needed 
You've never let me down 
I just don't know how I'd cope 
Without you being around 

Feelings have grown between us 
Though friends we have been 
Don't you think it complicates things 
Or is it just me 

Then I knew it was true 
All the feelings that you had 
I shared them too 
I could not deny 
Though many times I tried 

Give me a little more time

Give me a little more time 
I need to make up my mind
