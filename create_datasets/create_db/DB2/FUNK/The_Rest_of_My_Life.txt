Don't look now but there's another rocky road 
Another heavy "Why?" of the much to heavy, heavy load 
But today I'm gonna face it, yeah, 'cause I'm sick of dealin' any other way 
Nobody said the race was fair but I'm gonna keep runnin' just the same 

Today, today is the first day of the rest of my life 

Don't look now but here comes another heartbreak 
Benefit of the doubt I'll give it, control of my life I've gotta take 
Cause I'm alive and that's reason enough for me to bust a smile 
I've arrived and now I want to stay for a little while 

Cause today, today is the first day of the rest of my life 

Let's go 

Today, today is the first day of the rest of my life 
Today, today is the first day of the rest of my life
