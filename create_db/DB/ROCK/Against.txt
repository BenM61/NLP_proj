The more I see, the more I hate
The more I learn, the more I fake
The less I try, the less I get
The less I'm in, I'm never out

Don't do that, I knew it
Don't do that, I knew it, knew it

You don't know and I don't know
The circle seems the same
Falling down or standing up
I care what is against

Don't do that, I knew it
Don't do that, I knew it, knew it

What the f*ck, You blew it
What the f*ck, You blew it, blew it

Against!
Against!
