(verse two)
  
Grandmaster Flash,Affikaa Bambaatta
Starsky,Spoonie Gee and Rum DMC 
Gotta realize that he goes way back
And now he's down with the king
And we could never be whack
So just kick off you shoes and relax your feet
And rock to the rhythm of the Kurtis Blow beat
Yes,yes,y'all and just shake butt
Because AJ is gonna cut it up
  
(chorus)
  
Clap your hands (scratch)
