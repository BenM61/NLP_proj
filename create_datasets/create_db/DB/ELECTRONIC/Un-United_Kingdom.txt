Rule Brittania?
The bitch's scammed ya
No smiling union jacks
My friends, I want my money back

But what about the system?
I think no one would miss them
Brain-dead corpses in the house of lords
We could all learn a thing or two from Guy Fawkes

'Cause this is not the United Kingdom
No, this is not the United Kingdom
This is not the United Kingdom
This is not the UK

Rule Brittania?
What's she ever done for me?
Stuck a nail in the coffin of my national pride
And made the tourists hate me

This green and emerald isle?
Eight hundred miles of bile
High rise, car parks, ash tray dirt?
We could still learn a thing or two from Guy Fawkes

'Cause this is not the United Kingdom
No, this is not the United Kingdom
This is not the United Kingdom
This is not the UK

Breakdown
Rule Brittania
'Cause England never, never will be saved (ha, ha)

Rule Brittania?
Our first national scam
Watches starving children on her tv screen
While she's shacked up with her Uncle Sam
