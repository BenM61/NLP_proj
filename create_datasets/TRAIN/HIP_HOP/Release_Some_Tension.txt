(Foxy Brown) 
I'm the best and baddest chick that you've ever known
Uhhh, straight dissin' my flows, like cats be lickin' my toes, ohh
Betta backed up, only sex ones that are sacked up
Top dat, when in the Benz
Playa drop dat, ain't nothing free
Hope you got dat, more Cristale now pop dat
Can you rock dat, let me top dat
Got the pro togue, where the rocks at?
Ya'll sizin' me, all eyez on me
Let you down easy like the Isleys, and these dope rappers keep trying me
On GP 'cause I'm DP and none of ya'll broads can see me 

(Coko) 
Mmmm, What's your name 'cause you got game
I want to know, what it be like
What the deal iz? where my man at
Can you get with me
Say you got the things that I need
(I need)
What's your name, 'cause you got game
You want to know, who I roll with
Who I be with, who I'm down with
Do I like to do the nasty things that you do

Release some(some of your tension)
Pray for(pray for intermission)
For you and me(you start to kissin')
You'll see(what you've been missing) 
(repeat)
(repeat)

(Coko) 
Mmm, Your so fine I want to make ya mine
I want to know can I be with you
Can you be with me, on the count of three
Me and you
We can get romantically
Your so fine, I want to make ya mine
I want to know, do you got a girl?
Is she good to you, I bet she won't
Do the things I'll do to you

Release some(some of your tension)
Pray for(pray for intermission)
For you and me(you start to kissin')
You'll see(what you've been missing) 
(repeat)

(Foxy Brown) 
HO! who be poppin' them bottles
With them ballin' dat's honeyz
Who be smokin' dat hdro and be trickin' dat money
Trying to get uhhh me high, trying to open up
Then throwing up my knees wide, foreplay
From the first to the fourth day, sip Dom P's on my off days
Chincilla mnks and Morays make always
Cry for me, ain't too many broads who can do it like me
Name a chick who can do it like me
Get on top, can she move it like me? move it like me move it like me

Release some(some of your tension)
Pray for(pray for intermission)
For you and me(you start to kissin')
You'll see(what you've been missing) 
(repeat)
