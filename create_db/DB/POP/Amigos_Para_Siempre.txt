I don't have to say
A word to you
You seem to know
Whatever mood
I'm going through
Feels as though
I've known you forever

You
Can look into my eyes and see
The way i feel
And how
The world is treating me
Maybe i have known you forever

Amigos para siempre
Means you'll always be my friend
Amics per sempre
Means a love that cannot end
Friends for life
Not just a summer or a spring
Amigos para siempre

I feel you near me
Even when we are apart
Just knowing you are in this world
Can warm my heart
Friends for life
Not just a summer or a spring
Amigos para siempre

We share memories
I won't forget
And we'll share more
My friend,
We haven't started yet
Something happens
When we're together

When
I look at you
I wonder why
There has to come
A time when we must say goodbye
I'm alive when we are together
