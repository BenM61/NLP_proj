Midnight rockers, city slickers
Gunmen and me yeah
On a feature on the freak show
And I can't do nothing 'bout that, no no
But if you hurt what's mine
I'll sure as hell retaliate

You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight
You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight

Terious, terious, terious, infectious and dangerous
Friends and enemies find us contagerious
I was lookin' back to see if you were lookin' back at me
To see me lookin' back at you

Lucky deepest, crazy chances seems to be moving fast
What happened to the niceties of my childhood days
Well I can't do nothing 'bout that, no no
But if you hurt what's mine
I'll sure as hell retaliate

I was lookin' back to see if you were
I was lookin I was
I was lookin' back to see if you were lookin' back at me
To see me lookin' back at you

You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight
You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight

T-t-terious, infectious and dangerous
Friends and enemies find us contagerious
And they spread into your system like a virus
Yes the trouble is it kind of makes you anxious

I was lookin' back to see if you were lookin back at me
To see me lookin back at you
I was lookin' back to see if you were lookin back at me
To see me lookin back at you

But if you hurt what's mine
I'll sure as hell retaliate
You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight
You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight
