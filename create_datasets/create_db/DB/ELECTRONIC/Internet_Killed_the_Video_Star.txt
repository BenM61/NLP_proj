The kids are disco dancing
They're tired of rock and roll
I try to tell them "hey that drum machine ain't got no soul"
But they don't want to listen no

They think they've herd it all
They trade those guitars in for drum machines and disco balls
We can rewind now we've gone too far
Internet killed the video star

The kids are disco dancing
They're tired of rock and roll
Don't bother telling them that drum machine ain't got no soul
The kids are disco dancing

They're tired of rock and roll
Don't bother telling them that drum machine ain't got no soul
You know we never listen we think we've seen it all
Like everything we're doing no ones ever done before

Did you hear what they said?
That rock and roll is dead?
Yeah it's like a zombie ti will dig it's self back up again
Tune in the signal but it's fading

Some ghost strumming his guitar on the radio
Singing "oh the glory days are gone but everything OK
'Cause we still love our sex and drugs just like the good ol' days"
The kids are disco dancing

They're tired of rock and roll
Don't bother telling them that drum machine ain't got no soul
The kids are disco dancing
They're tired of rock and roll

Don't bother telling them that drum machine ain't got no soul
Well I'm a horrible dancer I ain't gonna lie
But I'll be damned if that means that I ain't gonna try
Yeah I'm a shitty romancer baby I ain't gonna lie

But I'll be damned if that means that I ain't gonna try
Get up get up get up and dance
Get up get up get up and dance
The kids are disco dancing

They're tired of rock and roll
Don't bother telling them that drum machine ain't got no soul
The kids are disco dancing
They're tired of rock and roll

Don't bother telling them that drum machine ain't got no soul
The kids are disco dancing
They're tired of rock and roll
They're tired of rock and roll
They're tired of rock and roll

We can't rewind we've gone too far
The internet killed the video star
The internet killed the video star
The internet killed the video star
