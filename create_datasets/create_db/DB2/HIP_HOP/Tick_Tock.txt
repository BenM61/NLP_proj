I gotta leave again
I don't wanna go
Things can be so lonely on the road
Could be the presidential suite
But nothing's ever like your bed at home
Especially when you're away from the one you love
It gets tough

Even though it hurts when I'm off at work
Looking at her picture soothes my pain
And for a moment I, find myself right back at home again
I remember, through the ups and downs of my day
I can say, my baby will be

Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for me
While the time goes tick tock tick tock
My baby will be
Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for me
While the time goes tick tock tick tock

She's gotta leave again
She don't wanna go
Hates to be away from me so long
She calls me everyday but
She can't kiss her baby on the phone
When we're hanging up
The tears start rolling down
But somehow oh

Even though she cries
She can find her smile
'cause she knows with me her heart is safe
Funny how time away, makes a loving heart grow fond again
She remembers, through the ups and downs of her day
She can say, oh that I'll be

Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for her
While the time goes tick tock tick tock
Her baby will be
Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for her
While the time goes tick tock tick tock

Oh, we remember, through the ups and downs of our days
We can say, oh that we'll be

Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for love
While the time goes tick tock tick tock
Oh we will be
Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for love
While the time goes tick tock tick tock

Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for love
While the time goes tick tock tick tock
Oh we will be
Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for love
While the time goes tick tock tick tock
