There is nothing special about me
I am just a lil star
If it seems like I'm shining it's probably
A reflection of something you already are

I forget about myself sometimes
When there's so many others around
When deep inside you feels the darkest
That is where I can always be found
That is where I can always be found
That is where I can always be found

Just keep trying and trying
It's just a matter of timing
Though the grinding is tiring
Don't let it stop you from smiling

Just keep trying and trying
Sooner or later you'll find it
It's surprising how inspiring
It is to see you shining

?Cause in the dark of the night you're all I can see
And you sure look like a star to me

There is nothing special about me
I am just a lil star
If you try to reach out and touch me
You'll see that I'm not really that far

Oh, I may not be the brightest
Nor am I the last one you'll see
But as long as you notice
That's just fine with me
Everything's just fine with me
Everything's just fine with me

Just keep trying and trying
It's just a matter of timing
Though the grinding is tiring
Don't let it stop you from smiling

Just keep trying and trying
Sooner or later you'll find it
It's surprising how inspiring
It is to see you shining

?Cause in the dark of the night you're all I can see
And you sure look like a star to me

There is nothing special about me
I am just a lil star
I'm running and jumpin'
But barely gettin', gettin' over the bar

I plan on being much more than that
And but that's in due time
But until then I'm guilty
And being human's my crime
Just being human that is my crime
Being human that is my crime

Just keep trying and trying
It's just a matter of timing
Though the grinding is tiring
Don't let it stop you from smiling

Just keep trying and trying
Sooner or later you'll find it
It's surprising how inspiring
It is to see you shining

?Cause in the dark of the night you're all I can see
And you sure look like a star to me
