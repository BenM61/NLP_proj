Oh... Oh...

Let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah
Let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time

I'm a cuckoo I know
Counting hours till we will be together
When the door to my heart will open
It's for sure that I will be hopin', hopin' that you

Will let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah, baby, oh, yeah, babe
And let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time
Let it begin

Cause every moment we're apart
Is some good feeling wasted
A good feeling deep down inside me told me
A good time for me to try to get you to hold me
Is right here and now so

Let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, baby
And let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time, for the first time

I wanna be your pendulum, baby
Striking your chime

Hickory dickory dock
I want to be your clock
Just set me for lifetime
And I'll wake you up every morning

Woo... Woo... Oh... Let me
(Let me be the clock for the time of your life)
For the time of your life (Oh, yeah), oh, yeah, oh...
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime for the first time
And every time after that cause I know where it's at

So let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, baby, ooh, ooh
And let me be the pendulum striking your chime for the first time
For the first time
