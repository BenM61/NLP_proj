We're breakin' out this time
Makin' out with the wind
And I'm so disconnected
I'm never gonna check back in

We're gonna start a new life
See how it goes
Before we're tired and too slow

We'll never get any other life
There's too far to go
So together we make this whole

Can you remember the moment
Did you forget that time?
We were switching a ride in the car coming by
On a Saturday night

You said there's nothing to wait for
There's nothing to know
Were never waking up if we never let it go
I said I wanna believe but I'm out of control
And I've got so far to go, whoa

It's coming out of the dark now
It's dripping off my skin
It's on the tip of my tongue as I drift through my body
Into the city within

And now the people are breathing
The air is alive
It's coming out of the street light
And now the battle is over
Whenever we decide that
There's nothing left to hide

This is all we've got tonight
This is all we've got tonight
We are young and still alive
Now the time is on our side

Right now, we'll make it right now
When every thought is electrical
Right now, we'll make it right now
The dream is coming

You're gonna see how it works
You're gonna see it connect
You're gonna see em surrender oh

Right now, we'll make it right now
Or nothing's gonna change
And maybe we already know the way
Forever every day

Do you know why the spirit's calling
For my end to see?
It reminds us we're alive, this moment,
Of who we are, what we could be

There's nothing to pray for
There's nothing to know
We're never waking up if we never let it go
The fever is coming
It's shaking the ground
The city's alive so tonight we break out
It's coming apart now it's not too far
We'll never know why we arrive where we are
We'll never know why we bring the seed in these times
But if you wanna get high kid, just open your eyes

This is all we've got tonight
This is all we got tonight
We are young and still alive
And now the time is on our side

This is all we got tonight
This is all we got tonight
We are young and still alive
And now the time is on our side

This is all we got tonight
This is all we got tonight
We are young and still alive
And now the time is on our side
