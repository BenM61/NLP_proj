The rain is falling, I can hear my baby calling
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
She says I need your loving and I need it very bad

You know I miss you, don't you know I want to kiss you?
You know I miss you, don't you know I want to kiss you?
'Cause I need your loving and I need it very bad

The sky is getting clearer, I know she's getting nearer
The sky is getting clearer, I know she's getting nearer
And when she comes home, I'm gonna hold her tight in my arms
