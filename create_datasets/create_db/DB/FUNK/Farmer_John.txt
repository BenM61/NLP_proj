A there's a dance spreadin' round like an awful disease
Hully, Hully Gully
Oh well you shake your shoulders and you wiggle your knees
Hully, Hully Gully
This dance goin' round from coast to coast
Hully, Hully Gully
When me an my baby do it, tryin' to do it the most
Hully, Hully Gully

[Chorus]
Momma hully gully, Poppa hully gully,
Baby hully gully too

Hully, Hully Gully
Shake your shoulders now, alright
Hully, Hully Gully

Moma hully gully, Baby hully gully
You can hully gully too

Well I went to a party now and what did they do?
Hully, Hully Gully
Now everybody's doin' it,now why ain't you?
Hully, Hully Gully
Everybody looks like he's got the space
Hully, Hully Gully
Just listen here brothers and as all of you take
Hully, Hully Gully

[Chorus]

Momma hully gully, baby hully
