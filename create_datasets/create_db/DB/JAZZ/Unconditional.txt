Daddy waited up, in the kitchen by himself
I came stumbling in that night
With liquor on my breath
He said, "Son I know you live here
But this is still my home
It's my way or the highway"
So I said alright, "I'm gone"

And before I slammed that door
I said, "I hate you"
But he just shook his head, and said ok

But you can't stop my love for you
It'll be here that's a given
As long as I am living on this earth
One thing is true
You will turn away, forget me
Curse my name but love won't let me let you go
Son always know, my love is unconditional

Life is like a circle
Slowing turning on itself
And girl it took losing you 
To finally know how daddy felt
But we stood in this bedroom
A year ago today
Hangin' on to pride and anger
As we threw our love away

And before you slammed that door
You said, "I hate you"
But tonight if only you could hear me say

That you can't stop my love for you
It'll be here that's a given
As long as I am living on this earth
One thing is true
You will turn away, forget me
Curse my name but love won't let me let you go
Girl always know
My love is unconditional

You will turn away, forget me
Curse my name, but you can even let me go
But you need to know
My love is unconditional
