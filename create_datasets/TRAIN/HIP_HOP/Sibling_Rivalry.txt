Lisa & Our life is so confusing,
Bart: No reason and no rhyme.
 We've got this funny feeling,
 Getting old before our time.
 Gimme what ya got,
 Gimme what ya got,
 I know what ya got,
 Gimme what ya got.
Lisa: What kind of love brings such confusion?
Bart: Shuts out the sun and kills all glee.
Lisa & What are these blues we're here to tell you?
Bart: It's sibling rivalry.
 I don't want to share,
 want to make you nuts,
 Gimme what ya got,
 Gotta have it all.
Bart: Sometimes I see her doing homework,
Lisa: I'm working hard all by myself.
Bart: And who can stand a happy sister.
Lisa: He hates I don't require help.
Back: Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Bart: I put a spider on her shoulder.
(Back: Oh, ya, wooh.)
Lisa: I'm not aware that it is fake.
(Back: Ooh, ooh, ooh.)
Bart: I ask her what the heck that thing is.
(Back: Eeww!)
Lisa: I turn and start; I scream and shake.
(Back: Scream and shake!)
Bart: Whhhhhhhy does it feel so good?
 My dear old fun?
 I know it's wrong to feel so mean,
 But, you shoulda heard her scream.
(Back: Ooh ooh, ooh)
Bart: Ha ha ha haa. Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
(Back: Ooh ooh, ooh)
Bart: Aah, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
(Back: Ooh ooh, ooh)
Bart: Ha, hahahaha. Ha haa.
(Back: Ooh ooh, ooh)
Bart: Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha hahahaha.
Lisa: I am not blameless in this equation.
Bart: She likes to talk over my head.
Lisa: Poor Bart, his trials and tribulations.
Back: Poor Bart.
Bart: Before a test she makes me dread.
Back: Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Lisa: 'Cause I predict that he will fail.
Back: Gonna flunk, woo-ooh.
Bart: I chase her down when she is right.
Back: Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Lisa: When I refuse to just turn tail,
Back: Hold your ground Lisa.
L & B: We have our most outstanding fights!
Back: Outstanding fights!
Lisa: What kind of love brings such contusions?
Bart: All these band-aids the world can see.
Lisa & What is this shame we're here to tell you?
Bart: It's sibling rivalry.
Lisa & A brother and a sister,
Bart: We're trying not to boast.
 But we can't help believing,
 That we'll always be this close.
Back: Siblings find it oh so hard,
 When it comes to giving,
 Let them once try singing
 Background for a living.
Lisa & A brother and a sister,
Bart: We will always be this close.
Bart: Let go my hand, Lisa.
