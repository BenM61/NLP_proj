The mountains are waiting
The full moon has come

I got lost on highways
But don't ask me where I've been
Or what I've done

Oh Lord send me transmission
Forgive me for what I've become

The Sun is gonna save me
Put a little love into my lonely soul

The Sun is gonna save me
Put a little love into my lonely soul

Oh don't you know I need her loving you
It's no desire
