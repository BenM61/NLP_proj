I'm waiting for the morning light
Then every night I wonder why
I always try to play it cool
I mean hello, but say goodbye
And I can't help myself
I'm wide awake all through the night
Keep waiting for the morning light

And here I'm all alone
Sitting by the telephone
And I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why
I keep laughing when I wanna cry
And I wonder why

Every day seems like there's no tomorrow
And every night I wonder why
Do I always seem to say it too
When things don't always turn out right
And there you sit inside my picture frame
But it's not the same
Ever since you said good bye

And here I'm all alone
Sitting by the telephone
And I'm wide awake, still wide awake, all through the night
Keep waiting for the morning light

I always try to play it so cool
And I don't know why
Gotta keep on smiling
Gotta keep on laughing
When I want to cry
I do believe it

And here I'm all alone
Sitting by the telephone
And I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why
I keep laughing when I wanna cry
Ooh, sing it

Sing it
