All in the name of love
All in the name of something beautiful
All in the name of love
All in the name of something beautiful

We don't even act like strangers
Seems we've been knowing each other for a long time
And every time that we've seen each other
We've come up with some reason to stay apart

But baby, love is in your eyes
Baby, let's make the compromise

I'll be your cover, in the wintertime
Any reason, any season
I'll be satisfied
Long as I'm here with you

You'll be my cool in the summertime
Any reason, any season
You're always on my side
Whatever I'm into

Can't you feel the magnetism
Growing stronger and stronger
So why don't we do it all


There ain't no doubt about this feeling
Yeah, it's obvious my search will end with you
And I can tell by your facial expression
That you have the same attraction for me too

But baby, common lets take the ride
We're destined, straight for paradise

All in the name of love
All in the name of something beautiful (oh)
All in the name of love (all in the name of love between me and you)
All in the name of something beautiful (all about, all about something beautiful)

All in the name of love
All in the name of something beautiful

You and me, we're overdue, for getting together baby
It always seemed our love was meant to be

(Hey) All in the name of love
(You and me, we've always had that strong attraction
You can't keep a lock on love, 'cause I've got the keys)
All in the name of something beautiful
(Hey) All in the name of love
All in the name of something beautiful
