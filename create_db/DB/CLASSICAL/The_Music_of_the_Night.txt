Night-time sharpens,
Heightens each sensation 
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write
For I composed the music of the night!

Barbra
Slowly, gently
Night unfurls it's splendor.
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender.

Both
Hearing is believing, music is deceiving,
Hard as lightning, soft as candle light,

Michael
There you trust the music of the night

Barbra
Close your eyes,
For your eyes will only tell the truth,

Both
And the truth isn't what you want to see.
In the dark it is easy to pretend
That the truth is what it ought to be

Michael
Softly,

Barbra
Deafening,

Both
Music shall caress you.

Barbra
Hear it,

Michael
Feel it,

Both
Secretly posses you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind,
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight,
The darkness of the music of the night...

Close your eyes start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before!
Close your eyes and let music set you free!

Only then can you belong to me

Floating (floating), falling (falling)
Sweet intoxication!
Touch me (touch me), trust me (trust me)
Savor each sensation!

Let the dream begin,
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write,
The power of the music of the night!

Barbra
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Aaaaaaaaaah, oooh

Michael
You alone can make my song take flight,
Help me make the music of the night

Barbra
Help me make the music of the night
