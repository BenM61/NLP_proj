Dead set in the morning
Dead set and I'm all alive
No two minute warnings
A road movie where no-one dies

Go find me a feeling
I give it you all the time
The sun in the ceiling
Won't give me the light tonight

Dead set in the morning
Dead set in the morning
Dead set in the morning
Feel it coming for me

I'm hearing you calling
And you're giving me all the signs
We're too busy stalling
To take it across the lines

Get back, get back
Get back, fast, fast

Dead set in the morning
Dead set in the morning
Dead set in the morning
Feel it coming for me
