Never see the big, church staple, when I call you on the phone
Never feel the rush of angels, when we stay up late alone
Never whisper you a great love story, only scream and cry or more
But you're a good man, but you're a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go
Oh, let go of the one who took all your gold

I get home and there's a love note waiting
But only he is here tonight
And the words, the promises you're making
Only echo all these lies
And for every sweet nothing you whisper
Why is goodbye my reply?
Cause you're a good man, cause you're a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go
There was someone that I knew before, a heart from the past
But I can not forget, and let him take all my gold, and hurt me so bad
But now for you, I have not been loved of all my go-gold

Stare my heart blank, am I ever gonna let him go? Get my gold back
And today I was a dead girl walking, city light birds, room for tears
Heard you say my name and get to talking of the love and all the fears
And you saw all the pain I was holding, and yet still you'd hold me near
Cause you're a good man, cause you're a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go
There was someone that I knew before
A heart from the past, that I can not forget
I let him take all my gold, and hurt me so bad
But now for you, I have nothing left
Cause there was someone that I knew before
A heart from the past, that I can not forget
I let him take all my gold, and hurt me so bad
But now for you, I have nothing left
All my gold
