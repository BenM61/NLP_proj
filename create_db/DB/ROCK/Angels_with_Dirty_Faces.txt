Who's got a dirty face then

Angels with dirty faces
Angels from nowhere places
Kids like me and you

Running fighting down the street
Ain't got no money but I don't cry
We're the people you don't wanna know
We come from places you don't wanna go

Angels with dirty faces
Angels from nowhere places
Kids like me and you

I'm never sad but sometimes lonely
Doing things someones told me
We're the people you don't wanna know
We come from places you don't wanna go

Angels with dirty faces
Angels from nowhere places
Kids like me and you

Angels with dirty faces
Angels from nowhere places
Kids like me and you

I'm a rebel stuck with a label
Trying to be someone in life
We're the people you don't wanna know
We come from places you don't wanna go

Angels with dirty faces
Angels from nowhere places
Kid's like me and you
