My love for you
Is deep and endless as the sea
Strong and mighty as a tree
My love for you

My eager heart
Keeps beating just for you alone
Since the moment it is known
My love for you

There'll be no other lips
No other eyes
No other love for me
Feeling as I do
How could there be

(And) so it will be
Far beyond eternity
Ever faithful ever true
My love for you
