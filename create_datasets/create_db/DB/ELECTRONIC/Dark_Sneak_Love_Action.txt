Baby, I love you
So what the hell am I a gonna do?
Baby, I need you
I need you like I need another shoe
You're wicked. you know it
You tease me all the day and all the night
I'm aching, I'm shaking
I'm so tired of holding on I cannot fight

Baby, convert me
Pull me back together. heal my soul
Baby, I'm praying
I'll die and go to heaven 'fore I'm old
Burn me, reduce me
Strip me down and burn me to the core
D'ja hear me. I'm hungry.
I've feasted on your eyes and I need more

Angel, fill me with your song 
Angel, you're stringing me along 

Baby, I love you
So what the hell am I a gonna do?
Baby, no foolin'
So when you gonna drop this being cool?
Maybe I'm crazy
But I don't give it up for just a kiss
I'm ready. rock steady
If you leave me like this you gonna miss
