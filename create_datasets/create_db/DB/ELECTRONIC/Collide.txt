I missed your arms around me
Now you found me, and we're floating off the ground
When I used to pass the hours, I was lost
But baby, now it's slowing down

I try to sink in the sound
The secret place that I found my voice in you (ah)
I looked all over your face
To find the reason it makes me feel so damn new

Our hearts forever glowing, there's something in your motion
I never saw the view, I swerve to collide with you
You're like a new creation, now there's no hesitation
There's nothing I can do, I swerve to collide with you

Your lips, they used to haunt me, but now you want me
And I'm falling off the ground
You took the fears that I made up
And now I'm not afraid of falling down

My arms wait for your call
I run to tear down your walls and I break through (ah)
I burned the bridges I crossed
To the secret place that I lost my heart in you

Our hearts forever glowing, there's something in your motion
I never saw the view, I swerve to collide with you
You're like a new creation, now there's no hesitation
There's nothing I can do, I swerve to collide with you

Oh, I crash into you and I'm better being broken
And you got me moving to your heartbeat, to your heartbeat
Oh, I crash into you and I'm better being broken
And you got me moving to your heartbeat, to your heartbeat

Our hearts forever glowing, there's something in your motion
I never saw the view, I swerve to collide with you
You're like a new creation, now there's no hesitation
There's nothing I can do, I swerve to collide with you

Our hearts forever glowing, there's something in your motion
I never saw the view, I swerve to collide with you
You're like a new creation, now there's no hesitation
There's nothing I can do, I swerve to collide with you
