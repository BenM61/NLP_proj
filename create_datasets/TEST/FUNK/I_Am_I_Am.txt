I am, I am

Lord, who will be with you
Every day, all the way, come with me
Your? come through
Thick and thin, back again
I'm gonna hang right in

I said I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah

I'll be standin' by
Prepared to take
Some heartache, for your sake
Can you did that, baby

What kind of fool am I
When winding up?
When the going gets rough
Can you did that, mama

I said I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah

And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn

Why do you give your love
And like?
Through youth and age
Can you dig that, baby?

What of the life you?
Realize your dreams
Though it may seem
Too extreme
Can you dig that mama?

I said I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah

And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn

I am, I am I am
I am I am I am, I am
Oh baby, I am I am I am
Oh, you bet your life I am

And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn
