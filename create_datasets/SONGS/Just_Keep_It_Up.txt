Well, one day baby, 
You'll be sorry 
For the way you make people cry 
It's not so funny 
Not one bit, honey 
One day you'll wake up and re-o-lise 

Just keep it up 
Just keep it up 
Just keep it up 
And see what happens 

One day you told me 
Oh, how you told me 
Things that made me shake inside 
And then you kissed me, 
Uummm, oh how you kissed me 
Then turned around and said you lied 

Just keep it up 
Just keep it up 
Just keep it up 
And see what happens 

Please stop doin' 
The things you're doin' 
I know we can get along 
Your luck will run out 
One day you'll see 
And then your lovin' arms will 
Belong to me 

Just keep it up 
Just keep it up 
Just keep it up 
And see what happens 

Just keep it up 
Just keep it up 
Just keep it up 
And see what happens
