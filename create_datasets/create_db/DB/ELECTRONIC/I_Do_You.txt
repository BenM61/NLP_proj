No one ever told me
A heart could ache as bad as mine
Boy, gotta tell ya
I thought that it would take my time

I thank you for the care
Now I know you're there for me
I tell you what I've found
Now you've come around for me

[Chorus]
Hey, if anybody loves you, ooh, baby I do you
If anybody loves you, ooh, baby I do you

I may be sentimental
To fall for you again this way
But maybe you know better
And this time you're gonna stay
I thank you for the care
Now I know you're there for me, yeah
I tell you what I've found
Now you've come around for me

[Chorus]

My heart Take my heart from nothin'
Turn it into somethin'
You know I love you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I thank you for the care
Now I know you're there for me
I tell you what I've found
Now you've come around for me

[Chorus: x2]

Hey, anybody loves you
Anybody loves you, ooh baby
