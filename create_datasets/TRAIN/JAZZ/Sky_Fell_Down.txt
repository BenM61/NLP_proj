The sky fell down when I met you 
The green of the countryside had turned to blue 
I had the moon right on my fingertips 
And when first we kissed 
There were stars on your lips 
To be with you just made it seem 
That walking on snowy clouds was not a dream 
You gave to me all this and heaven, too 
When the sky fell down 
And I met you!
