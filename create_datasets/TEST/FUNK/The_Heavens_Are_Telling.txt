The heavens are telling
Of God and His glory
A mighty God we serve
They speak of His character
Awesome Creator
A mighty God we serve

Angels bow before Him
Heaven and Earth adore Him
No other God above Him
A mighty God we serve

Hail the power and glory of God
Hail the power and glory of God

The earth and skies, glory
The land and seas, God's glory
The flowers and trees, glory
You and me, God's glory

Everything He does
He does it well

He does it well
What a mighty God we serve
