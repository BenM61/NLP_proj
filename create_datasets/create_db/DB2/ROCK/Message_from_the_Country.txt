Here the roar a coming
Here the roar a coming
Here the roar a coming now

Got news for your mother
Got news for your mother
Got news for your mother tonight

Sister, I have touched the evergreen
And I promise that it's life should go unseen
Now it saves the birds upon the fire
And the message from the country rises higher

Hear the birdie calling
Hear the birdie calling
Hear the birdie calling for life

Message from the country
Message from the country
Message from the country rising high

Sister, I have touched the evergreen
And I promise that it's life should go unseen
Now it saves the birds upon the fire
And the message from the country rises higher
