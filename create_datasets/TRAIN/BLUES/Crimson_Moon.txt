Crimson moon, in the early morning
Blue black sky, tell me why?
If she loves me
My baby drives me wild

Like a little child
She's standing on the edge, she wants to learn to swim
She looks in the water but she won't dive in
Crimson moon, tell me why?

She's like a new spring flower
Come out to play, in a gray day in autumn
She brightens up the day
But does she know that winter's coming?

Jack Frost in on his way
You've got to hide little girl from his icy stare
Run back to the sunshine, he won't catch you there
Run little girl run

Crimson moon, In the early morning
Blue black sky, tell her I love her
She will listen to you
Tell her she can hear the heartbeat of a dragonfly
In full flight

Taste the spring water of a mountain stream
And feel the burning kiss of a lover's dream
Tell her I love her, she will listen to you
Tell her I love her, she will know that it's true
