Voodoo chute, why don't you tie the noose
From circus through to senseless way?
Rhythm healer is your force to feed her
Let me inside of your gaze

And turn on nice and slowly
You don't even know me
Come closer to the knife

I'm seeing the truth within
My heart was filled of sin
Oh, a lot of virtuous sacrifice

And there's a natural mystic in the air
And darling you're looking at me with that innocent stare
Are you really, do you feel, and are you really there?

And there's a natural mystic in the air
And darling you are looking at me with that innocent stare
Said are you really, do you feel, and are you really there?
Ah, ah, yeah

Voodoo go now I ask for your direction
Please put your hands up in the air where I can see them
I see I'm surviving myself and now you're drowning in my dreamin'
I forgot my peace when I knew it was there
Lonesome wandering soul of the earth my heart was bare
I kiss the ground, know I was never found, I guess I laid my ego to rest

And there's a natural mystic in the air
And darling you are looking at me with that innocent stare
Said are you really, do you feel, and are you really there?

And there's a natural mystic in the air
And darling you are looking at me with that innocent stare
Said are you really, do you feel, and are you really there?
Ah, ah, yeah
