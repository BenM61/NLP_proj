Can't feel the running on your mind
'Til your young 
 
Just remember that your mine
Just remember that your mine
Is cool if you are gone and now
Just remember your mine
Tell you what you need the ways are wrong
Let all since but keep me on your side
 
Just remember that your mine
Just remember that your mine
Is cool if you are gone but now
Just remember your mine
Tell you what you need the ways are wrong
Let all since but keep me on your side

Zipping honey telling you to be 
And all the things I say comes a 
Bright green in your eyes 
Is cool if you are gone but now
Just remember your mine
Tell you what you need the ways are wrong
Let all since but keep me on your side
