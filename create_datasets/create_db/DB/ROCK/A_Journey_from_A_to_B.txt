I measured the distance from Heaven to Hell
How will we do only time will tell
Oh when you stop worrying
What anyone says doesn't mean a thing

Just tell me you're feeling it
And you're not disbelieving it

I'll pay you in kind or silver and gold
I want to ignore all the stories untold
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
You know if I win then that means you lose

Just say you believe in it
That you're not, not feeling it

Dwelling on the memories
Is such a waste of energy
It's simple when you see it in front of you
On walls, in bedrooms

Hold you're head up higher
Don't tell me you're not strong enough
If your journey's over
I hope you feel that I am the one
Only time will tell

Just say you'll be loving me
For an eternity

Oh I feel tired of all of these games
Everywhere, everything is the same
Tell me you'll promise you might come with me
The start of a Journey from A to be	

I'll be happy to carry you
Even though I know I haven't got the strength to hold you
I need you more than ever before
If our journey's over
I hope that you will find someone who will love you more

Now not for the first time
What I want might not be mine
If you say you won't come along
Then I know I can't go it alone
