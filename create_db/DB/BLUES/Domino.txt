I close my eyes like I don't know
I count the hours 'til the sun's burning gold
I fill your bed so it ain't cold
I know that heartbreak is the loneliest road

I think about it
All through the night
All through the night, whoa
All through the night
All through the night, whoa
All through the night
All through the night, whoa
One by one, they fall so fast, I let 'em go
Domino
Domino

I close my eyes, don't wanna read
Between the lines you keep on keeping from me
I fill your bed, it's getting old
I know that heartbreak is the loneliest road

I think about it
All through the night
All through the night, whoa
All through the night
All through the night, whoa
All through the night
All through the night, whoa
One by one, they fall so fast, I let 'em go
Domino
Domino
(Woo, woo)

I close my eyes like I don't know
I count the hours 'til the sun's burning gold
I fill your bed so it ain't cold
I know that heartbreak is the loneliest road

I line 'em up (I line 'em up), they're tumbling down
And when they leave, the truth is getting too loud
'Cause when you start, can't stop the train
On broken tracks, it's all feeling the same

All through the night
All through the night
All through the night
All through the night
All through the night
All through the night
One by one, they fall so fast, I let 'em go
Domino
Domino
(Woo, woo)
