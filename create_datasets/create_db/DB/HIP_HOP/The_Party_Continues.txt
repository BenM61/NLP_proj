While y'all drive match box,
I push the hot wheels,
Don chichi wit' da mass appeal,
Lettin' champagne spill,
From my house to my grill, see,
All I'm about is dat dolla dolla bill,
Makin' ya dance every chance i get,
Make you say damn do we every catch bricks,
Nah, I dont catch those,
Keep it getto, stay wit' the best,
From the east and the west, now what?
Now, every way I pass,
They wanna see the big booty,
Mamma tap me some ass,
And whether you believe it or not, you see us,
So So Def make y'all true believers,
My whole entourage keep it top notch evidently,
We push V's from Bentley to drop,
Got big thang baby I still greedy,
To my enemies I hope you keep envyin'.

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah, yeah yeaaaah,
All we wanna do is party with you.

She da one who love drama,
Keep it heated, stay undefeated from the Chi comma Illinois,
My crew makes more noise than yours,
Fifteen in one do tour make 'em sick with no cure,
As she sits by da bar she sips cristy,
In the mist of da party,
They bump hits by J.D.,
Da B-R-A-T, we da element,
And you irrelevant, get down off this shit,
I don't pay attention to your hatin' and your bad looks,
We just tryin' to get paper like Garth Brooks,
Keep it off the hook,
Make the world feel the touch,
Y'all doin' too much,
Sayin' y'all can see us,
Its like this hear,
I rock a party wit the Cartier wrist wear,
Light skin, pretty face, wit' the long hair,
And I got lots of dough,
Lots it stow,
The C. to the E. O.,
What you wanna do?

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah, yeah yeaaaah,
All we wanna do is party with you.

See, I get goose bumbs,
Wit' da baseline thumps,
So phat they call me Professor Clump,
I ain't gone front yeah I like to flass,
And I aint gone lie about the girls I tossed,
Better ask your lil' man where his dough went,
Needed mo' rent, we got bent,
You know da rest,
I split, spent some,
Lent some to my friends,
If you wanna get down, you gotta get in.

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah,
Yeah yeah, yeah yeaaaah,
All we wanna do is party with you.
