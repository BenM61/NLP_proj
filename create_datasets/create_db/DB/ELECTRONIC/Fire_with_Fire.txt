You can see that you're being surrounded
From every direction
And love was just something you found
To add to your collection

It used to seem we were number one
But now it sounds so far away
I had a dream we were running from
Some blazing arrows yesterday

You said, fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire

Now the city blacks out the sun
That you know is rising
You can show me the work that you've done
Your fears have been disguising
Is it just me or is everyone
Hiding out between the lines
What will we be when we come undone
Just a simple meeting of the minds?

And we'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire

Underneath your skies
There's a million lights
Burning brightly just like fireflies

It's cold and heaven surrounds you from every direction
Cause there's someone behind every hand
That you've made a connection
And now we're free to be number one
The morning isn't far away
I had a dream we were holding on
And tomorrow has become today, become today

And we'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
