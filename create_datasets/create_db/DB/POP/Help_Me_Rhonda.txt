Since she put me down I've be out doin' in my head
Come in late at night and in the morning I just lay in bed
Oh well, Rhonda, you look so fine, I know it wouldn't take much time
For you to help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my heart

She's gonna be my wife and I was gonna be her man
She let this other guy come between us and it ruined our plans
