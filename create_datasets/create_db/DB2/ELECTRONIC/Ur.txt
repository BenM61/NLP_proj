Wish I was a better man 
Wish I had a better plan for dealing with this 
What am I 
What am I to do now? 

Maybe I should run away 
Maybe I could run away and never be found 
What am I 
What am I to do? 

The way that I'm feeling 
The dreams when I'm dreaming 
Can this really be happening 
Can it really be true? 

You are 
My love and my life 
My heart and my soul 
Just trying to keep the world 
From smashing crashing in 

I had this dream the other night 
I had this crazy dream the other night 
How have I 
How have I arrived here? 

My heart is unleaded 
and my head is exhausted 
Is this powerful magic 
Can it really be true? 

You are 
My blood is in your blood 
My breathe in your mouth 
Just trying to keep the world 
From smashing crashing in 

What about us? 
What about all the plans that we made? 
What about all those careful plans 
Just careful plans we made 
An else is clear (!?) 

Full of Fear 
Full of Hope 
Full of You 

My love and my life 
My heart and my soul 
Just trying to keep the world 
From smashing crashing in 

My blood is in your blood 
Just trying to keep the world 
From smashing crashing in
