I never meant to make you cry
A fool I was, I never meant to say goodbye
Can't you feel the pressure drop?
Can't you feel the pressure's off?

Heaven's here in front of me
I can't breath and I can't see
Baby, I never realized.....
As the days and the nights roll on

I've prayed for this moment since the day I was born
Nut, oh god, baby I never realized
The joy 'till the joy was gone
I know I'm wrong, I know I was so blind

But worst of all, I saw the tears, I saw you cry
Can't you feel the pressure drop?
Can't you see the pressure's off?
Heaven's here in front of me

I can't breath and I can't speak
Baby I never realized.....
And you can build walls to surround you
But I'll tear down this world 'till I've found you

You're the treasure, believe me, I need you
Come home.....
As the days and the nights roll on
I've prayed for this moment since the day I was born

Nut, oh god, baby I never realized
The joy 'till the joy was gone
And as time rolls on
I've been fighting since the day I was born

But, oh god, baby I never realized
The joy 'til the joy was gone
Hold on, hold on, hold on
