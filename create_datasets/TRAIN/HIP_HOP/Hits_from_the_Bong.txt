Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong

Pick it, pack it
Fire it up, come along
And take a hit from the bong
Put the blunt down just for a second
Don't get me wrong it's not a new method
Inhale, exhale
Just got a ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double barrel bong is gettin' me stoned
I'm skill it, there's water inside don't spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it, goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky funky smelly green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong

Hits from the bong y'all
Gonna get high
Hits from the bong
Gonna get high
Hits from the bong
Gonna get high
Hits from the bong

Let's smoke that bowl, hit the bong
And then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it, unplug it
Don't strain, I love you Mary Jane
She never complains, when I hit Mary
With that flame, I light up the cherry
She's so good to me, when I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don't get me stirred up the smoke, through the bub-bling water
Is makin' it pure so I got ta', take my hit and hold it
Just like chong, I hit the bowl and I reload it
Get my four-footer and bring it on

As I take hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit
Straighten your dick out
Can I get a hit
