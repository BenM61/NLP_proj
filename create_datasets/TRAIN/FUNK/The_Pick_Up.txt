I've got such a crazy feeling 
And I've got to find somewhere to go
I've got such a crazy feeling 
And I've got to find somewhere to go

I've got to find the kind of man
Who knows just how to love me 
Don't you know, don't you know
I beg your pardon, what did you say
Well, yeah

If you're the right kind of man
Man I don't dig your sounds at all
Cadillac's don't excite me
I've got one of my own
And that don't either
Is that all

Well don't be mad
Just cool down now
Don't be so quick to give up
It may happens sooner than you think
Well, I don't know
I've gotta be home by two
Is that a promise
That sounds crazy
Well lets go then
