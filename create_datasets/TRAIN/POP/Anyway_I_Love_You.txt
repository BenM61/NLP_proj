Here's another little song for you
Hope you'll listen to it well
Means no different than the others do
It won't change you I can tell

Anyway, I love you
Everyday I get more sure
Anyway, I love you
More and more and more and more and more

I have so much I can offer you
More to please you with than most
But trying to tie you down is harder than trying to hold on to a ghost

Anyway, I love you
Everyday I get more sure
Anyway, I love you
More and more and more and more and more

So if you ever feel the need for me, darlin'
Let it carry you along
Don't be shy and try to hold it down
'Cause what you feel just can't be wrong

Anyway, I love you
Everyday I get more sure
Anyway, I love you
More and more and more and more and more

More and more and more and more
And more and more and more and more.
