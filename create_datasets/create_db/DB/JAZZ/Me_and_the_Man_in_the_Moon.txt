Why did my sweetie leave me? 
Why did we have to part? 
You know, no other sweetie can relieve me 
Of this aching heart

Why can't I have the sunshine? 
The sunshine instead of gloom? 
Why must I have these little shadows 
Creeping in my room? 

When the night is dark and peaceful
Loving hearts are all in tune
There's two lonesome people in the whole wide world
It's me and the man and the moon 

When the little birds are nesting
And I listen to them croon
There are two lonesome people in the whole wide world
It's me and the man and the moon

While I lie there counting sheep
Through my window he comes to peep 
And with each other we're sympathizing! 

Oh, I'm looking at those happy people 
While they sit around and spoon
There's two lonesome people in the whole wide world 
It's me and the man and the moon 

Oh, but if my sweetie keeps me waiting
You know what I'm gonna do? I'll get another sweetie, soon
Because there's two lonesome people in the whole wide world
It's me and the man and the moon

Oh, how I miss his ukulele
And the way he strums those tunes
'Cause there's two lonesome people in the whole wide world, 
It's me and the man and the moon

When the creepy shadows fall 
And the boogie man comes to call 
I need two lovable arms around me! 

You know, and if my sweetie keeps me waiting
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get myself a big balloon, a big one
And I'll travel through the air in that big balloon and have a love affair
With the man in the moon!
