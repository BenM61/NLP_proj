Strangely, I feel a connection with you, babe
Oddly enough I crave for it to remain purely
More authentic than I've been used to
Surely this can't be something that's taboo 'cause you...

(Bridge)
Got it like I like it, and I feel the need to say
Baby, it's forever, and I really mean to
Make you feel as special as I see you, baby
Never have I ever been around someone
Who makes life so free and life so fun
And as crazy as it may sound; I ain't joking, baby

'Cause when I'm in those arms of yours
I'm so gone
The things I like
Can't tell me it's not right
When I'm with you
I lose myself and no one
Can make me do
What I can't wait to do when I'm with you

Really, I get inspired off you, baby
Truly, I feel alive from you
And you're the only
No one else can duplicate you
I'd leave the one I have; I know
It's sad but, damn, you...

(Bridge)

'Cause when I'm in those arms of yours
I'm so gone
The things I like
Can't tell me it's not right
When I'm with you
I lose myself and no one
Can make me do
What I can't wait to do when I'm with you

The times that we've shared together
Are some of the best times of my life
I wish you were the one
I could be with forever

'Cause when I'm with you
I don't want tomorrow to come
And if I had my way
I'd spend every day and night in your arms
So let me lay here
And feel what happiness feels like
And wish for it to last because
Tomorrow - it's back to real life

Until then
I'll just keep dreaming

'Cause when I'm in those arms of yours
I'm so gone
The things I like
Can't tell me it's not right
When I'm with you
I lose myself and no one
Can make me do
What I can't wait to do when I'm with you
