Let's undo all the distance
From your guts down to your buttons
And get lost in your existence
What you, what you, what you wanna do?
And if you wanna get real
And if you wanna get honest
Then baby you know the deal
What you wanna do?

Better open up
'Cause it feels much better
When we open up for each other
And I know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When you know somebody
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And they know your body
It's so much better

Show me what's under your t-shirt
And bare it like it's your first time
You take it off like you never
Like you've never been hurt

Open up (open up) 'cause it feels much better (much better)
When we open up (open up) for each other (for each other)
And I know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When you know somebody
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And they know your body
It's so much better

So good, so good, so damn, so good
So damn, so good, so right, so good (yeah)
So good, so good, so damn, so good
So damn, so good, so right, so good
When you know somebody, when you know somebody
When you know somebody, when you know somebody
When you know

Oh, oh, oh, (oh-oh) oh, oh, oh (oh-oh)
When you know somebody
Oh, oh, oh, (oh-oh) oh, oh, oh (oh-oh)
And they know your body
Oh, oh, oh, (oh-oh) oh, oh, oh (oh-oh)
When you know somebody
Oh, oh, oh, (oh-oh) oh, oh, oh (oh-oh)
And they know your body

Oh, get to know my body
Better and better
Better and better
Damn
It's so much better
