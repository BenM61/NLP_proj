Seems so strange, you're putting me through changes
Baby, I can't believe you're not the same sweet girl that I once knew
But baby, the change has come about and it don't look too good on you
It seems so strange, you're putting me through changes
Baby, you've started doin' things you should not be doin'

CHORUS:
Livin' above your head, girl; you're comin' on way too strong
You're livin' above your head, girl, and something has got to go wrong

Baby, don't think that I don't know you're runnin' out with other guys
And baby, though it hurts me so, you know that I'm still hypnotized
Don't let my pride kill all the love inside of me
Baby, you've started doin' things you should not be doin'
