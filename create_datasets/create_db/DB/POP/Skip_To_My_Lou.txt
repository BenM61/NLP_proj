Put on your Sunday, go to meetin'
And I'll take you by the hand
If you will be my dancin' partner
We will dance to beat the band

So join the promenade
And lead the big parade
And if you don't get home at all
Your pa will understand

Oh, choose partners, skip to my lou
Choose partners, skip to my lou
Choose partners, skip to my lou
Skip to my lou, my darlin'

Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, shoo, shoo
Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, shoo, shoo
Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, shoo, shoo
Skip to my lou, my darlin'

I'll be glad to go with you
So prithee do not tarry
But if I do, it's up to you
To let me dance with Harry

Corner boy, buck and wing, corner girl
Ida booth by to the center and whirl
Everybody dance

I'll find another one prettier than you
I'll find another one prettier than you
I'll find another one prettier than you
Go to another party

Oh, I'll fly away to a neighborin' state
I don't care what my friends say
We'll dance and sing till broad daylight
I won't get home till Wednesday
(Skip to my lou)

Skip, skip, skip to my lou
Skip, skip, skip to my lou
