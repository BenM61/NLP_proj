Its like looking at the windows of a train moving fast.
Before we know it baby, the days just fly past.
Time don't have a minute. 
Its never gonna wait.
It all gets so crazy, just got to get away.

[Chorus]
One on one, just me and you, some time alone, just us two.
All I need, until we see the morning sun,
Is a little one on one.

I just want to be beside you, and shut out all the rest.
In the silence feel you, breathing soft against my chest.
Get down to the basics, why we're even here at all.
Take this world we live in, and make it really small.

[Chorus]

One on one,
Oh

[Chorus]

One on one, one on one,
One on one
