Are you dead yet

Don't hear, don't deem. drown in before you dive
Don't care, commit to your self destruction drive
I kiss the ground with love beyond forever
Flip off the sky with bleeding fingers till I die

Enemy, take a one good look at me
Eradicate what you'll always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?

Wake up, don't cry. regenerate to deny the truth
The fiction you live in blindfold your eyes
Disclosure, self loathing. this time you've gone too far
Or could it be, my nemesis that you are me?

Enemy, take a one good look at me
Eradicate what you'll always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore
Should I regret or ask myself are you dead yet?
