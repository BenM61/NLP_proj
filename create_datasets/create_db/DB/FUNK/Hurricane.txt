Standing here in disarray comes serenity
The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide, gonna hold on
All the walls around are broken down
Now I can hear the rising sun

Surrounded by everything I want, but nothing that I need
I was blinded by the absurdities, losing all identity
Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need to find that road
Right around that curve, a lesson learned...
Now that I have the eyes to see

A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

With poise and toys I'd isolate
But the wind was strong and true
But now I see where the treasure is
'Cause they only blocked my view

Spiraling down but so oblivious, got to find my way home
There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me
But how do I break this shell of stone?

A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

Sometimes I'd cry, but tears wouldn't fall
And sometimes I'd try to break those walls and feel your love
But I came alive inside when I finally found my way

A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane...a hurricane
Sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

A hurricane...a hurricane
It's sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane...
