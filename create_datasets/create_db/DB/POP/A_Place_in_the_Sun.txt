Well everybody's heart needs a holiday, some time
And everyone of us needs to get away, some how
'Cause laughing light-hearted moods
Oh, sight seeing afternoons
And telling a joke or two
'Cause everyday invites you to find your place in the sun

It's time to find your place in the sun
Find your place
Find your place in the sun
Its time to find your place in the sun

Well everybody's panning for gold
And you can find it for a price
And love always promised us to last forever
But sometimes it just don't work out
'Cause laughing lighthearted tunes
Oh, sometimes time they turn to blues
So tell yourself a joke or two
'Cause everyday invites you to find your place in the sun

It's time to find your place in the sun
Find your place
Find your place in the sun
It's time to find your place in the sun
Come on now
Come on now
It's time to find your place in the sun

'Cause 
And sightseeing afternoons
And telling a joke or two
'Cause every day invites you to find your place
'Cause every day invites you to find your place in the sun
It's time to find your place in the sun
It's time to find your place in the sun
It's time to find your place in the sun
Find your place
Find your place in the sun
It's time to find your place in the sun
It's time to find your place in the sun
