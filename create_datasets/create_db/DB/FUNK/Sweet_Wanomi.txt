In a room with soft satin pillows
Cracklin' fireplace keeps us warm
Whisprin' wind through weepin' willows
And sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms

In a soft light her eyes are gleamin'
Pretty little hand covers
Up her mouth when she yawns
Wake me up, I must be dreamin' that
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms

Sleepy kisses, warm me softly
Get much warmer later on
I reach for the light and turn it off
Uh, huh, sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms

Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
Sweet Wanomi restin' in my arms
