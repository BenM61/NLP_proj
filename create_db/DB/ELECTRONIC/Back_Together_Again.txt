It seems we've weathered
Hard times we've been through
In silence I've waited
I've missed you (miss you too)
 
[Chorus]
'Cause you you and I back together again
We got the world in a spin
'Cause you you and I back together again,
We got the world in a spin
 
It's all come together
Problems we've defeated
I'm here heart in hand
You take all that I got if you need it baby
 
[Chorus]
 
Love will last forever (that's true)
We can make it real (got to be real)
Say you'll leave me never
We can truly feel (watcha feel) (I feel like getting)
 
Back together
(Baby keep it real and I will be there till the end)
 
Younger and wiser
Time has shown the way
We've come full circle here to stay (here to stay)
(We got the world)
 
[Chorus]
 
You know the deal
My life story from broke
We always talked about the bad times that turned into jokes
We spoke about you leaving the town, yo I was down
But now you're back in my life
I'm happy to have you around (I hold you down)
Remember the fun we have when we're young
You thought it was done, never none
We haven't begun
Together we come the land of living
I'm giving my heart to you every part
You the one I'm feeling
 
Truth is the light
It's the joy that we both share
Make love day and night
It's so easy to do when you care

[Chorus]
