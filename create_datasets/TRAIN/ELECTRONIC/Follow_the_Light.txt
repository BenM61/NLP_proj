Beautiful mystery
Just a dream
Don't turn round, push them up
Trust in me

Follow, follow
Follow, follow
Follow, follow
Follow the light

Beautiful mystery
Just a dream
Don't turn round, push them up
Trust in me

I'm just a dreamer
You are just a dream
And when I'm sleepless
You all come to me

Follow the, follow the
Follow the light

Beautiful mystery
Just a dream
Don't turn round, push them up
Trust in me
