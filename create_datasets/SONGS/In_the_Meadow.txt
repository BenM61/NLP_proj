Can I ever love again?
Can I ever love again?
Can I ever love again?
Like we did in the meadow
I've been ready before today
It's just a drop or two away
Let my body rise
So you can play tricks with my mind

I keep thinking too much, you're not thinking enough
(Can you help me? Can you help me?)
You got a funny way of tricking my memories
(Take it from me! Oh, take it from me!)
Cause it only takes my shadow to put me on the floor
(With my lady)
Show me what I'm waiting for

As my mind drifts closer to the water
When will you appear?
I've been waiting all day long
For you to come sit over here

But all the work has been keepin' me hollow
(Can you help me? Can you help me?)
Oh yeah, I think the sun is workin' fresh until tomorrow
(Follow it down! Oh, follow it down!)
You got my place it's as thin as the walls and the ceiling
(Can you help me? Can you help me?)
Ah girl, I live so simple, such a glorified feeling
(Follow it down! Oh, follow it down!)

Cause every time I'm tired
I hear him wheeling through the trees and the wind
As he watches over me and sings
(Yeah it sings!)
Yeah it sings
(Yeah it sings!)
Oh, it's singin
I look up
All my pain's just brought me closer to fear
Give me a couple watts to ring in my ear
(In my ear!)
In my ear
(In my ear!)
In my ear
