I said leave me alone
1 2 3 he let go of me
I said leave me alone

I will find another man to chase you down
I will find another man to chase you down
I will find another man to chase you down
I will find another man to chase you down
I will find another man to chase you down
I will find another man to chase you down
I will find another man to chase you down
I will find another man to chase you down
