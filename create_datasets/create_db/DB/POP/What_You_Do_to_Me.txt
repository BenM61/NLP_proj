Come a little closer
Baby I don't want a thing to block the view
Hey, I'm on a natural high
And I get this way each time I look at you
I'm on a cloud
Not coming down... 
I'm a new man when I'm around you
Girl, anticipate
Each new day
'Cause I know
I'm gonna spend my time with you

Ooo, what you do to me baby
The little things you do keep me loving me you
Ooo, what you do to me baby
Everyday together just gets better

Lord, it's some kind of magic
That excites me 'bout the things you do and say
I just can't get enough
Seems I want you more with every passing day
I'm just a fool
When I'm with you
It doesn't matter where we are just hold me
Don't let go
I'll listen close
My heart is singing
A symphony of love, baby

Ooo, what you do to me baby
The little things you do keep me you
Ooo, what you do to me baby
Everyday together just gets better
Ooo, what you do to me baby
Ooo, what you do to me baby
Everyday together just gets better

Ooo, what you do to me baby
The little things you do keep me loving you
Ooo. what you do to me baby
Gonna spend my time lovin' you

Girl, I act a fool
When it's me and you
Baby, can't you see
What you do to me

You got me on cloud
And I'm not coming down
Baby don't stop the magic
'Cause you are my fantasy

Ooo, what you do to me baby
The little things you do keep me loving you
Ooo, you do baby
Everyday together just gets better

Got a lot
Lot of lovin' baby
You got my number
Rang me every mornin'
