It's every loss and every love 
It's every blessing from above 
Here I am, all added up 
Oh, it's all right here 
It's what I know, and what I'm guessing 
Half truths, and full confessions 
It's why I choose to learn my lessons 
Oh, it's all right here 
(Chorus) 
And I'm not God, I'm a girl - I confess 
That I don't have a sea of forgetfulness 
No, it's all right here 
It makes me stronger, it makes me wince 
Makes me think twice when I pick my friends 
Oh, it's all right here 
It's all right here 
It's caution and curiousity 
And tt's all the things I never see 
Welling up inside of me 
Oh, it's all right here 
It's what is best, and what is worse 
It's how I see the universe 
It's in every line and every verse 
Oh, it's all right here 
(Chorus) 
Every heart has so much history 
It's my favorite place to start 
Sit down a while and share your narative with me 
I'm not afraid of who you are 
I'm all here, and you're all there 
Some of this is unique, and some of it we share 
Add it up and start from there 
Well, it's all right here 
(Chorus) 
It's caution and curiousity 
It's all the things I never see 
Oh it's all right 
It's what is best, and what is worse 
It's how I see the universe 
Oh it's all right, it's all right here 
I'm all right here
