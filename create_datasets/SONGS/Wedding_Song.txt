What once was a dream 
Will now become 
Two hearts 
Will now be one, hey 

We're gonna write the book on happiness 
Pages that time cannot erase 
Starting here and now, oh, oh
Starting here and now, ooh, oh, oh
From this time and place 

Oh, what a beautiful day 
To take a vow 
Pray that the things that we say 
Will last from now on 
I do take you for mine 

We're gonna lock our lives together now 
Unshakable, unbreakable embrace 
Starting here and now 
Starting here and now 
Starting here and now 
From this time and place 

Oh

What love has joined together 
Only love can put asunder 
And we are 
What love has joined together
