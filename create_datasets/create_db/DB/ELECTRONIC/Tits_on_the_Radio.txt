Creamsicle sky while the sun sets up in the west 
Where are the queers on the piers, heard they gave it their best 
Now they got jobs at a local fast food chain 
Flippin' tricks for the burger, since Lady M jacked their fame 
Flippin' tricks for the burger, since Lady M jacked their fame 

Cause you can't see tits on the radio 
I'll give you five fingers for a one man show 
Fasten those pants for the lap dance 
Take a shot now this may be your last chance 

There ain't no tits on the radio (Oh no) 
There ain't no tits on the radio (Oh no) 
There ain't no tits on the radio (Oh no) 
There ain't no tits on the radio (No no) 

Dark room Danny can't see with the lights turned out 
Black haired tranny counts sheep with her bed turned down 
But the bed's in Jersey and the sheep's on a farm 
Dark room Danny hears police alarm 
Dark room Danny can't see with the lights turned out 
Dark room Danny can't see with the lights turned out 

Cause you can't see tits on the radio 
I'll give you five fingers for a one man show 
Fasten those pants for the lap dance 
Take a shot now this may be your last chance 

There ain't no tits on the radio (Oh no) 
There ain't no tits on the radio (Oh no) 
There ain't no tits on the radio (Oh no) 
There ain't no tits on the radio (No no)
