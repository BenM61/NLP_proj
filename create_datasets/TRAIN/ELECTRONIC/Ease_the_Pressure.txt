If you're feeling low, well I can ease the pressure
If you should let me know
That I can ease your troubled mind
If you don't ever go then I can give you pleasure
If you can tell me so, then we can leave it all behind

I'll lift you up
(I'll lift you up, girl I'll turn you 'round)
I'll lift you up
(I'll lift you up, girl I'll turn you 'round)
I'll ease the pressure, the pressure,
The pressure, the pressure
(I'll ease the pressure, I'll ease the pressure)

if you talk to me, then I will tell you something
Like how it ought to be
If you will tell me that you're mine
If you believe in me, I will give you one thing
(one thing)
So feel the need in me, and I will ease your troubled mind

I'll lift you up
