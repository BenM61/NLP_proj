Fragile you never were
Standing up to building up to
Anger that will never show
Your limitations in self control

I don't want you back
I can't deal with that
'Cause everybody has to have a weakness
Somewhere
But never you
I'm coming undone
You rip me up so you can?

Have it your way
See it your way
You're the one on top now
And this is your day

Words magnetise.
They fascinate and terminate
Each breath separates
what you need from what you hate
I'm not just a right to use up when you like
And I don't want you drilling through my conscience
Pleasure under your control
It's not negotiable can't you see you have to?

Have it your way
See it your way
You're the one on top now
And this is your day

And I'm so weak just like you planned
And you're too strong to understand

Fragile you never were
Standing up to building up to
Anger that will never show
Your limitations in self control

I don't want you back cause I can't deal with that
And everybody has to have a weakness somewhere
But never you I'm coming undone
You rip me up so you can...

Have it your way
See it your way
You're the one on top now
And this is your day

And I'm so weak just like you planned
And you're too strong to understand
