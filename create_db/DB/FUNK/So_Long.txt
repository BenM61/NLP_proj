So long, don't know where I'm going
But so long; you know you done me wrong
So long, because I know I'm not the one

Goodbye, please tell me why
Goodbye, you always make me cry
Oh why, why are you never satisfied?

So long, I'm all packed up and on my way
So long, you'll need me some ol' sunny day
So long, yes, I'm, I'm going to stay
