Oh, I was warned about her love
But like a fool I went on
Whether they're right or wrong
At least the mystery is gone

The more people talked about her
The more I had to see
I had to find out for myself
What could she do for me

Her lips were so inviting
Her hands soft to touch
After just one kiss
I knew I was out of luck

From then on I was hers to control
And knowing that, she robbed me
Of my heart and robbed me of my soul

Oh, I was warned about her love
And I'll have to stay strong
Whether they're right or wrong
At least the mystery is gone

From then on I was hers to control
And knowing that she robbed me of my heart
And robbed me of my soul, yeah

Oh, I was warned about her love
But like a fool I went on
Whether they're right or wrong
At least the mystery is gone

She had a left hand filled with diamonds
And the other filled with lies
She saw right through me
There was no place to hide

Now I've finally learned my lesson
But you'll never tell the pain her love left me
I hide so well, I go on day by day in fear
And knowing that I'll never, never love again
Only brings tears

Oh, I was warned about her love
And I'll have to stay strong
Whether they're right or they're wrong
At least the mystery is gone

Whether they're right or wrong
At least the mystery is gone
I was warned about her love
