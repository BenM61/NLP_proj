I've stained the land
Millenniums I've prayed
Now I know there's no release

Since paradise is lost
I hold a crown 
I know your name
But I am just your
Fallen angel of doom

Thus heaven denies
Refused for all times
I am not guilty at all

Deadlands, wastelands
Darkness will cover my mind 
And oblivion shall reign
I made up my mind
And oblivion shall reign through the night
Deadlands, wastelands
Darkness will cover my mind 
And oblivion shall reign

Still we are one, you and I
Realize, I did what you wanted me to

The lack of pure souls and the fading light 
It's me you blame

First there was light 
Then came the night 
Cruel nothingness

Thus heaven denies
Refused for all times
I am not guilty at all

Deadlands, wastelands
Darkness will cover my mind 
And oblivion shall reign
I made up my mind
And oblivion shall reign through the night
Deadlands, wastelands
Darkness will cover my mind 
And oblivion shall reign

Hope turns to despair
There's no one in these barren lands
The lust for light
I'm sure that it will fade
It will fade
Spiritus Sanctus
The lust for light 
I'm sure that it will fade
Spiritus Sanctus

Eternal hell
