It's gotta be you (bomb your head to this) 
It's gotta be you 
No one else can do 
All the things you do 
I miss the way you feel 
Can't believe you're gone for real 
I gave you all I had 
A lover's paradise gone bad 
I see you in the movies 
And on the paper 
And in every face I know 
I'm trying to forget you 
But I can't, girl 
True love is not for show 
It's gotta be you 
No one else can do 
all the things you do 
It's gotta be you 
Give me one more chance 
To get next to you 
It's gotta be you 
(HERBIE): 
It's gotta be you 
Really what I need 
Really what I want 
And I really know 
I really want you back 
You got me like a zombie 
Nymphomaniac gettin' numb 
So you really miss 
My little kitty cat 
It's gettin' kind of crazy 
Grounds gettin' shaky 
Got myself a triple hit 
And everything is black 
Crowned it like a bomb built me up 
And now you're gone 
'Cause you let me have a friend 
I'm bad, that's a fact 
I see you in the movies 
And on the paper 
And in every face I know 
I'm trying to forget you 
But I can't girl 
True love is not for show 
It's gotta be you (it's gotta be you) 
No one else can do 
all the things you do 
It's gotta be you (it's gotta be you) 
Give me one more chance 
To get next to you 
It's gotta be you (it's gotta be you) 
I need a second chance 
I need sometime to understand 
Is this how it all will end 
No explanations in your game 
Bomb your heads to this, come on you
