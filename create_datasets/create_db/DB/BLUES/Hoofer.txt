What's coming down
Don't look good to me
It's definable as critical
In webster's dictionary

But let's just say I got a feeling
That when this stuff hits the ceiling

At no time will my feet leave my ankles
At no time will my feet leave my ankles

I don't need
Really all that much
Big limousines and movie queens
Don't get me going as such

But when I can't vote for a president
And be total sure that he ain't bent

At no time will my feet leave my ankles

So I break off
Yeah I just take off
Anything that's bothering me
Sing you a love song
Hope it ain't long
Before the roses bloom
In the afternoon
We're gonna see them soon

If you don't let them get you down, don't let them get you down
Don't let the long faced ugly mother wearing a frown, get you down
Don't let them get you down, don't let them get you down
Don't let the long faced ugly mother wearing a frown, get you down, ah-ah ah-aaah

So I break off
Yeah I just take off
Anything that's bothering me
Sing you a love song
Hope it ain't long
Before the roses bloom
In the afternoon
We're gonna see them soon

If you don't let them get you down, don't let them get you down
Don't let the long faced ugly mother wearing a frown, get you down
Don't let them get you down, don't let them get you down
Don't let the long faced ugly mother wearing a frown, get you down, no no
Don't let them get you down, don't let them get you down
Don't let the long faced ugly mother wearing a frown, get you down
Don't let them get you down, don't let them get you down
Don't let the long faced ugly mother wearing a frown, get you down, get you down
Don't let them get you down, get you down, don't let them get you down
Don't let the long faced ugly mother wearing a frown, get you down
Don't let them get you down, don't let them get you down
Don't let the long faced ugly mother wearing a frown, get you down
