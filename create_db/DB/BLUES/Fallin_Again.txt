I caught the last bus down to the harbour
Where the moonlight's on the sleeping sea
A pretty girl stood there at the bus stop
She said hey Johnny come and see about me.

She said Doop Doop.
So many seamen able and willing
Have passed through these arms on their way to the sea
They leave me tokens of love and affection
When I drank from her lips I tasted the sea.

She said Doop Doop.
How can a young girl hope to survive
Living alone when there's no-one alive
Out in the night she swallows her pride
And she says catch me Johnny I'm falling again.

I jumped a freighter bound for Mombassa
I worked every day neath a burning sky
l wrote her sea poems and nautical letters
I remember her words till the day that I die.

She said Doop Doop.
