DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY WITH YOU
We could drink until we get real high,
Try to drink every bar dry.
Taste so good that high price stuff
You never know when you've had enough.
But there is nothin' I would rather do
Than to dance, dance the night away with you.
We could talk the whole darm night away
''cause we got so much to say.
I could talk holes in your head,
Remember every word I said.
But there is nothin' I would rather do
Than to dance, dance the night away with you.
 We could climb a mountain high
 or walk a valley deep
 or we could get stoned
 and fall off a lover's leap.
We could talk the whole darn night away
''cause we got so much to say.
I could talk holes in your head,
Remember every word I said.
But there is nothin' I would rather do
Than to dance, dance the night away with you.
There is nothin' I would rather do
Than to dance, dance the night away with you.
There is nothin' I would rather do
Than to dance, dance the night away with you.
There is nothing I would rather do
Than to dance, dance the night away with you.
