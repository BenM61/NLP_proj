A finger's touch upon my lips 
It's a morning yearning 
Pull the curtains shut, try to keep it dark 
But the sun is burning 

The world awakens on the run 
And will soon be earning 
With hopes of better days to come 
It's a morning yearning 

Another day, another chance to get it right 
Must I still be learning 
Baby crying kept us up all night 
With her morning yearning 

Like a summer rose, I'm a victim of the fall 
But am soon returning 
Your love's the warmest place the sun ever shines 
My morning yearning
