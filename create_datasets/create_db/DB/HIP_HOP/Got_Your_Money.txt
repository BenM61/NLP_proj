Ol' dirty on the hat and I let you all know 
Just dance! If you caught up in the Holy Ghost trance 
If you stop! I'ma put the killer ants in your pants

Every eye, don't you be watching me

In the ground where you can not be found

Lucky dog when I won the lotto 
Ran up on my car for carrying kilos 
You can call me dirty, and then lift up your skirt 
And you want some of this dirty, god made dirt and dirt bust yo ass
