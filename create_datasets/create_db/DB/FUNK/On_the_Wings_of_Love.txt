Just smile for me and let the day begin
You are the sunshine that lights my heat within
And I'm sure that you're an angel in disguise
Come take my hand and together we will rise

On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love

On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high Upon the wings of love

You look at me and I begin to melt
Just like the snow when a ray of sun is felt
And I'm crazy 'bout ya baby, can't you see
I'd be so delighted if you could come with me

On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love

On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high upon the wings of love

Yes, you belong to me
And I'm yours exclusively
Right now we live and breathe each other
Insepreble it seems

We're flowing like a stream
Running free flowing
On the wings of love

On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love

On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Together flying high

On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love

On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high upon the wings of love, of love
