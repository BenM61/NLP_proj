I met her down by the water
She took me into her full like a mother
I sent her some flowers for the weekend
And she sent me away on a mission
I went into another land

Starin' into one another's green pools
We're a couple o' blue fools
Starin' into one another's green pools
We're a couple o' blue fools
Thank God that they don't ask us why
We can't get high
Blue fools

Never had any sisters or brothers
Spent all my time lookin' for another
Keeping all of my thoughts in a locket
Before I knew it she picked my pocket
I turned into another man

Starin' into one another's green pools
We're a couple o' blue fools
Starin' into one another's green pools
We're a couple o' blue fools
Thank God that they don't ask us why
We can't get high
Blue fools

Starin' into one another's green pools
We're a couple o' blue fools
Starin' into one another's green pools
We're a couple o' blue fools
Thank God that they don't ask us why
We can't get high
Blue fools
