It feels like snow has come again
It's taking hold of everything now
I'm calling out to you again
To you again

The wild nights have gone again
And through the silence
I hear you somehow
I'm calling out to you again
To you again

I'm out in the cold night
Still so in love So alone
I'm out in the cold night
Calling to you
Pick up the phone

She says
Maybe if you don't feel right
Everybody loves
Everybody loses
Maybe we get hurt sometimes
Maybe it's time to be alive
Maybe it's time to be alive
Maybe it's time to be alive

I feel us fade to black again
I walk from here
But I make it somehow
I've been to hell
But I'm back again
I'm back again

I'm out in the cold night
Still so in love So alone
I'm out in the cold night
Calling to you
Pick up the phone

She says
Maybe if you don't feel right
Everybody loves
Everybody loses
Maybe we get hurt sometimes
Maybe it's time to be alive
Maybe if you don't feel right
Everybody loves
Everybody loses

Maybe we get hurt sometimes
Maybe it's time to be alive
Maybe it's time to be alive
Maybe it's time to be alive

Maybe it's time to be alive
Maybe it's time to be alive

Maybe if you don't feel right
Everybody loves
Everybody loses
Maybe we get hurt sometimes
Maybe it's time to be alive
Maybe if you don't feel right
Everybody loves
Everybody loses

Maybe we get hurt sometimes
Maybe it's time to be alive
