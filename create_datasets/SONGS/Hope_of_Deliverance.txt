I will always be hoping, hoping
You will always be holding, holding 
My heart in your hand 
I will understand 

I will understand someday, one day
You will understand always
Always from now until then 

When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us 

Hope of deliverance 
Hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

And I wouldn't mind knowing, knowing 
That you wouldn't mind going, going along with my plan

When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

Hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

Hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

Hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

Hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance (I will understand)
Hope of deliverance 
Hope of deliverance (I will understand)
Hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance (I will understand)
