My mind keeps drifting back 
To things we said this morning 
Now I'm sitting here alone 
Watching the world pass me by 
Every time we part I feel like I'm falling 
No matter what you think 
I still love you 

You will always be a part of me 
No matter what we do 
You will always hold a piece of me 
Wherever I may go 
Always... 

The sky gets darker 
And I sense that you are far and away 
I miss the times we had when things were going our way 
But every time we part you know how much it hurts me 
No matter what you think 
I still love you.
