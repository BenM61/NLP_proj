The late summer sunshine down on her
Been walking all day in town of love
On her own going home
Only if someone were there who would understand
How it is feeling like this
So she said, pardon, parlez-vous English?
Where do I find the bus station?
I got a little lost cause I have never been here before
Never thought I would feel so alone, away from home

I'm so lonely
Why don't you show me around?
I'm so lonely
Why don't you take me downtown?
I'm so lonely
Oh what would I do without people like you?

This is what happened
I got so scared of the man who was standing there
cause he started to talk and I just didn't understand 
Oh...
So I start to run and I run and run
He was following me so I didn't stop
My heel came off and then I saw you
I've been looking for you
I need a friend

I'm so lonely
Why don't you show me around?
I'm so lonely
Why don't you take me downtown?
I'm so lonely
