Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Gangster whitewalls tv antenna in the back
You may not have a car at all
But just remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you've got
Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, digging the scene
With a gangster lean gangster whitewalls
TV antenna in the back

You may not have a car at all
But just remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you've got
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, digging the scene
With a gangster lean ooh ooh ooh
Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Gangster whitewalls tv antenna in the back
You may not have a car at all
But just remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you've got
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, digging the scene
With a gangster lean
With a gangster lean
With a gangster lean
