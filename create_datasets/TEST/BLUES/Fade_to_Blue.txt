Faded curtains, faded moon, through a broken sky
Staring at a photograph, the ghost of you and I
Those were times, yeah, those were good times that we shared
We thought those nights would never end

I should've seen it comin', runnin' with a fallen angel
Livin' on a broken promise when the day is through
Tryin' to make a life for us, I only knew it my way
I'm just a shadow on the highway, fade to blue
Fade to blue

I hear you cryin' in your sleep, I can feel it 'cross the miles
Love unspoken runs so deep like the tears behind your smile
Those were times, yeah, those were hard times that we had
I'd even take them back again

Should've seen it comin', runnin' with a fallen angel
Livin' on a broken promise when the day is through
Oh, tryin' to make a life for us, I only knew it my way
Another shadow on the highway, fade to blue

I fade to, I fade to, I fade to blue
I fade to, I fade to, I fade to blue
Every night I fade to blue
I fade to, I fade to, I fade to blue
Every night I fade to blue

There'll be times, girl, there'll be good times on the way
I'll always be comin' back again

Should've seen it comin', runnin' with a fallen angel
Livin' on a broken promise when the day is through
Oh, tryin' to make a life for us, I only knew it my way
Another shadow on the highway, I fade to blue

Oh, I fade to blue
I fade to blue
Fade to blue
Fade to blue
Fade to blue
