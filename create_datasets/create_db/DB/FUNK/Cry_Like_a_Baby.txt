Nobody knows except my pillow at night
All through the day how many tears I have to fight
Oh when I'm all alone yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
Oh I cry
I cry
Oh yeah

Nobody sees except my mirror on the wall
I'm not the fairest I'm the bluest of them all
And, Oh 
When I'm all alone yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
I cry
I cry
Oh yeah

Each day I say tomorrow will be my lucky day
Ah ha yeah
And my pillow will be surprised when I come home with a glad eye
And the mirror on the wall will see that I am happy one more (?)

No more nights staring at daddy's chair 
Because I know that you will be standing there
Oh oh, when I'm alone I won't

Cry like a baby
Cry like a baby

Oh yeah
Said I won't cry
I won't cry like a baby
Wooo hooo no
Oh ho yeah
I said that I ha
