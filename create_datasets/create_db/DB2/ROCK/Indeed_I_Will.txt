Riding on the walls of your precious souls, yeah,
Indeed I will, indeed I will, yeah.
Praise it to the skies, everyday I rise,
Indeed I will, and indeed I will.

Starting over, born in anew,
Finally the lone will ignite its gown 

Now I'm walking through

And now the world gets hotter,
With your hand in mine, when you're with me baby
Be happy to take it, just days our lives,
Indeed I will, yeah, 
Yeah, indeed I will

God my remake, loves the creed,
I can't even bite on my nails, 
To the gales of my own sweet epiphany)
Watching those low light shadows

Stretching out behind, when you're with me baby,
Be happy to take it, these days are fine, days are fine,
And every little move 
I feel like waiting by the turn of the table

Now my eyes are welling up
And they're just thinking bout the way that it felt,
Yeah, every bone, every nerve, every fiber, in my body, screaming, yes
Indeed, I will
Indeed I will.
Indeed I will, yeah

Riding on the walls of your precious soul,
Indeed I will, indeed I will, yeah.
Praise it to the skies, everyday I rise,
Indeed I will, indeed I will.
Every little moment I feel like waiting there to turn at a tail

Now my eyes are welling up
And they're just thinking bout the way that it felt, yeah,
Every bone, every nerve, every fiber,
In my body, screaming, yes
Indeed, I will.
Indeed I will.
Indeed I will.
Indeed I will, yeah

Praise it to the skies, everyday I rise,
Indeed I will, indeed I will, yeah
Riding on the walls of your precious souls.
Indeed I will
Indeed I will, yaeh
Popping like a cork down in old New York,
Indeed I will. 
Indeed I will, yeah
