See her world lit so bright
See her bird take flight
See her face wild and charged
See her quickened heart

So if we fall, imagine that
Imagination's fine
So here I hold for what you are
See all that I'm looking for

I look to you
The future we've found
To stay here on higher ground

The future we've found
To stay here on higher ground

I look to you

I wanna change the future as I look into your eyes
I wanna change the future as I look into your eyes
I wanna change the future as I look into your eyes
I wanna change the future as I look into your eyes
Future as I look into your
Look into your
Look into your eyes

I look to you
The future we've found
To stay here on higher ground

The future we've found
To stay here on higher ground

The future we've found
To stay here on higher ground

The future we've found
To stay here on higher ground

I look to you

I look to you
The future we've found
To stay here on higher ground

The future we've found
To stay here on higher ground

I look to you
