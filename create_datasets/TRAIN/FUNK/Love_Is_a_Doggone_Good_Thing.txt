Love is a doggone good thing
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
It's just the way you do it, baby, sing that way

Your love is wider than any ocean can be
It's plain enough for that old blind man to see that

Love is a doggone good thing
'Cause it ain't nothin' to it
It's just the way you do that make it seem that way

You can throw me in a lion den and I don't mind
My faith in you will fight off any old lion
'Cause love is a doggone good thing, good thing, good thing

Love is a doggone good thing
'Cause it ain't nothin' to it
It's just the way you do it that make it seem that way

You can throw me in a lion den and I don't mind
My faith in you will fight off any old lion
'Cause love is a doggone good thing, yes, it is

Love is a doggone good thing
Good thing, good thing, good thing
Love is a doggone good thing
Good thing, good thing

Love is a doggone good thing
Good thing, good thing, good thing
Love is a doggone good thing
Good thing, good thing
