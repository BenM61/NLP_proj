There's a song I know, I know - too well
An there's a place I go, I go to dwell
Some forsaken land, where you're not around
Desiring, dividing your time 
Nothing I could do it was pretty risky
Fifty-fifty, she'll make good problem for me

She's as cold as ice, she deep frozen
She's a saint at home, devil abroad
Calculated cool, so worldly wise
If you take my advice, just hightail out of there
Go right ahead before she tells
Some cock-and-bull story about some school boy
She neurotic, psychotic, you name it, she's got it
Ooh Another great divide, another great divide
(La-la-la)
Now how can I figure this equation, if multiplication's the rule
You keep subtracting me from you, and it just doesn't add up at all
How can I figure this equation, if multiplication's the rule
You keep subtracting me from you, and it just doesn't add up at all

Ooh another great divide, another great divide
Just another great divide, just another great divide
Just another great, just another great, just another great divide
