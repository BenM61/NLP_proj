I've got sunshine pouring down on me
And the sea shining like pearls
I've got wine cooling in a palm tree shadow
Now all I need is a girl
I've got blue skies up ahead of me
And a real thirst to see the world
I've got time off to go and spend my money
Now all I need is a girl
For a girl with a gentle like sensuous touch
Is a girl
Who would leave me out of wanting for much
Now with a girl in my arms to dance the whole night through
Like lover do
Yeah
I've got moonlight on a starry sky
Just the right kind for pretty curls
I've got two seats for the late night theatre
Now all I need is a girl - Is a girl
For a girl with a gentle like sensuous touch
. . .
I've got moonlight on a starry sky
. . .
