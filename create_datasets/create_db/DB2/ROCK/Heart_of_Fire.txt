Driving through this world unknown, I've built my life on broken bones
Not living for this anymore, you want a fight I'll bring a war
I feel alive inside I won't be terrorized, I'll take all the blame

This heart of fire is burning proud
I am every dream you lost and never found
This heart of fire is stronger now
Build your walls but you can't keep me out
I'll burn 'em down

I am every vow you broke, they left for dead and turned to smoke
Arm yourself with words of hate, I'm ripping through the souls you take
I feel alive inside I won't be terrorized, I'll stand up to the pain

This heart of fire is burning proud
I am every dream you lost and never found
This heart of fire is stronger now
Built your walls but you can't keep me out
Let's burn it down!

This heart of fire is burning proud
I am every dream you lost and never found
This heart of fire is stronger now
Build your walls but you can't keep me out

This heart of fire, fire, fire
This Heart of fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire)
This Heart of fire
