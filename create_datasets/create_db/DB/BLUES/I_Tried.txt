Maybe I could have loved you better 
Maybe we only needed time 
We couldn't make it last forever 
But I tried 

I tried 
Maybe I gave my heart too easy 
Maybe your heart was never mine 
I did my best to make you happy 

Yes I tried 
You know I tried 
Who knows where the love goes 
When the loves gone 

You just hold on 
And you hold it all inside, yeah 
I tried to give you love 
It was not enough 

It was not enough to keep you satisfied 
Maybe I couldn't make you love me 
But I tried 
You know I tried 

I tried to just give you love 
It was not enough 
It was not enough to keep you satisfied 
I couldn't keep you in my life 

And so I'll have to let you go now 
Guess now I got to say good-bye 
I'll learn to live my life without you 
I don't know how 

But I'll try 
Yes I'll try 
Oh guess we couldn't make it baby 
After all this time we just couldn't get it right 

But I tried 
Yes I tried
