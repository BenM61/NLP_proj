Wherever you're going
I know you knew
That nobody cuts me
Quite like you do

And i'm gonna crawl
Not that it matters
Nobody bleeds the way I do

Wherever you've gone
I can follow
The path of destruction
You leave like crumbs

And i'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna scratch and claw
Though i am broken, i still bleed
Whoever said?
No wind, no rain, no conversation
Will bring me back alive

I got it bad and i won't sleep
Until i breathe the sweet perfume
You love

You're gonna crawl, my precious
I'm untethered
Waving in the wind like feathers
Feel you near me, disappearing
If you take, you better kill me

Break me, steal me
If you don't kill me
I'm gonna crawl, til you crawl
Crawl like them all, my precious
I'm untethered
Waving in the wind like feathers-
Crawl, my love-
