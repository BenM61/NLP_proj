You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you,
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew.

You're right out of a book,
The fairy tale I read when I was so high;
No armoured knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

I'd fly out of this world
If you said we were through,
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you;
I'll spend the next eternity or two with you.
