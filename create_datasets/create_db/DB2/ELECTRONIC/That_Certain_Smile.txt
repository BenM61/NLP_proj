
Cross your heart and hope to die it's love.
A perfect world in my minds eye and oh

The face that's watching me tonight - has me -
Falling for that certain smile.

Hold your hand up
swear to God
it's love.
Help me to believe
because for all
The words you said to me tonight - has me -
Falling for that certain smile -
Falling for that certain smile.

Take my tears and smile for me
it's love.
Take my soul
my heart
my fears for oh

The way you're touching me tonight - has me -
Falling for that certain smile.

Bring me passion
bring me lust or love.
Bring me only truth
because for all
The times you said to me tonight - have me -
Falling for that certain smile -
Falling for that certain smile -
Falling for that certain smile -
