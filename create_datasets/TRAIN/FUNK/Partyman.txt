Gentlemen, let's broaden our minds
Lawrence

All hail, the new king in town
Young and old, gather 'round, yeah
Black and white, red and green, funky
The funkiest man, you've ever seen

Partyman, partyman
Rock a party like nobody can
Rules and regulations, no place in his nation
Partyman, partyman

Party people, say it now, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Somebody holler if you wanna party
Ladies and gentlemen, no pictures, please

Get it up, oh yeah
Partyman, Partyman
Get it up, get it up
Ooh, I love purple

I rock the party, I rock the house
I rock the whole world
North, East and South
In the West, seventeen horns blowin'

Partyman, partyman
Lose me now boy
Get it up
All hail the new king in town

Ain't nothin' but a muffin
We gotta lotta butter to go
Why'say aye, an' I like ya 'way, but don't come now
And if it break when it bend
You better not put it in

Giddy up

Partyman, partyman

Young and old, gather 'round
Everybody hail, the new king in town
