All this life shrouded in a veil
Of deception in association
But now I will witness thee
With unblinding open eyes
Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was suppose to be
Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove
I spread the fuel with ire
Desire
To incinerate all - behold I rise - phoenix
Ascend above the ashes
Ascend above it all
