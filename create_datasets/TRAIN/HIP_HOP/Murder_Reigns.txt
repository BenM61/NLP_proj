Yeah
I feel the rain comin down on me nigga, heh
When the sun gon' shine? 
My lord, somebody help us all, heheh

I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder

Ja Rule baby!
Last Temptation, time to kill these niggaz
Dear Lord, can you, feel my pain

If you can't it's alright, cause I'ma live my life anyway
Just let, it, rain - on me
I feel, so free like a, cool breeze
And when the sun, gon', shine
Fold up the mini-blinds, load up the lucky 9
And hit 'em up from behind
That's, my, life - and it'll never be the same
Ever again, the game is to blame
Don't get caught up in your Range Rover, pullin over
On the Westside highway shoulder, nigga I'll blow ya
like a windshield, leave yo' mind on the windshield
And have yo' whip doin windmills, that's what rain feels
like, when it's hittin a little harder than drizzle
And pickles flyin out pistols, gotta niggaz cryin they Christians and
I can't believe shit has come to this
It's unheard of, now it's gonna reign down murder

I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder

God only breathes with the best of them, bury the rest of them
A storm is comin', I got a hundred mile runnin' head start
on these niggaz cause it's murder for life
Drugs, bitches, and money be my only vice
But I'm livin life in the fast lane, doin the damn thang
In the Ferrari hard top watchin "Hard Rain"
It's a damn shame, no more games
No more love, baby boy I throw back slugs
through your Green Bay throwback, I hits that up
And let you know where the reign is from
You ever heard of mixin whiskey with Jamaican rum? You get Biggie
Mix gin with a little cocaine, you got me
And my style is a little too savage to not be
Be looked upon as one of the illest to MC
y'all niggaz want it with me? That shit's unheard of
Cause niggaz, now it's gonna reign down murder

I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder

Nobody loves me

Sometimes I wish the good Lord would come down and hug me
I take a look at my life, it's gettin' ugly
And now I know that you all want to slug me
I can get above it, it's my life and I dug it
Even though I live it close to the edge
I'm gettin' closer to death, with every little step
that I take, in the awake of my last days
I hope the sun shines with a light rain
That would mean the world shared my pain
And now the world could be happy again, smile
Cause if I ever walk "The Green Mile"
You can look at me and blame it on my lifestyle
What can I say? I was raised as an only child, lonely
Poppa didn't show me, so the streets raised me
To call me crazy is not unheard of
Now it's gonna reign down murder

I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder
I think the reign is colling murder
