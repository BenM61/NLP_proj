After all I've come to know me, and the ways of my heart,
And the young man that I once was would have torn our love apart.
When you're young and always looking at the far side of the hill
You might miss the fairest flower standing by you very still.

Love, love, love, love, love, such is love,wonderous love
Love, love, love, love, love, such is love,wonderous love

Love is never, like the stillness, love is always passing by
Love must flow like a river; try to hold love back and love will die
If I'd known as a young man what I know of love today
I'd have lain down in that river and let it wash my soul away.

Love, love, love, love, love, such is love,wonderous love
Love, love, love, love, love, such is love,wonderous love

Now I know love.
