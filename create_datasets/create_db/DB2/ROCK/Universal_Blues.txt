If I had one day that I could do
Yeah, would it be enough?
Alright and if I hold my head
Could I hold it all?
Yeah, could I hold it again?
And a heart goes a long way

And if I had it all
(And if I had)
As she comes screaming after
Oh I say

Who do you think that you are?
(Who you think that you are?)
What are you trying to do to me?
(What you tryin' to do to me?)
Well, can't you see?

Hey, alright
Hey and if I had it all
And if I had it all again
Baby, would you come back to me?

Hey, and I tried to get back
To the start when I'm born again
I bet I'm born again
And now I'm really gone

Coke and ice
Coke and ice
Coke and ice
Coke and ice
