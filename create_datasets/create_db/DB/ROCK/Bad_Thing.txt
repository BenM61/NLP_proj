Just a new way you got over me
You got it all wrong
Just a new song
That I gotta sing
You got over me

Just a new way
Just a new way

End of the line
You're rollin' away
And stop on a dime

God you're so wrong
When you wanna play
But way down inside
You want to stop while you're playin'

No more of a bad thing
No more of a bad thing
No more of a bad thing
No more, no more, no more

Find a new way
Got a new ride
It won't take too long

Found a new thing
It's better with time
You know I'll be fine
I'll take you there if you say you're mine

No more of a bad thing
No more of a bad thing
No more of a bad thing
No more, no more, no more

Just a new way you got over me
You got it all wrong
Just a new song that I gotta sing

You got over me
Just a new way

No more of a bad thing
No more of a bad thing
No more of a bad thing
No more, no more, no more

No more of a bad thing
No more of a bad thing
No more of a bad thing
No more, no more, no more
