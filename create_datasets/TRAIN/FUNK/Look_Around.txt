Listen lover, let me tell you
Something I've been longing to say
Lately you've been distant
Growing further every day

A heartbreak is a hard thing
And it's something we don't have to do
Girl, I'm telling you the truth
So hear me out, so hear me out

Just look around, baby
Look around and you're gonna see
Just look around, baby
No one's gonna love you like me

So you tell me what you're feeling
Has nothing to do with me
I know imagination's
Not getting the best of me, no

Still the feeling's changing
Where's the magic in your touch
And the world you used to love so much?
Can you help me out? Can we work it out?

Just look around, baby
Look around and you're gonna see
Just look around, baby
No one's gonna love you like me

Look around, baby, baby
Oh darling, baby

Love is a feeling you're looking for
And it's living right here
Behind our doors, our doors

Just look around, baby
Look around and you're gonna see
Just look around, baby
No one's gonna love you like me

Go on, look around, baby
Baby, you can take your time
Oh baby, take your time and look around

Oh, look, look, look around, baby
Look around and you're gonna see
Just look around
No one's gonna love you like me

Go on, take a mirror tonight
I'm tellin' you, girl
That no one's gonna love you like me
Oh, look around, baby, baby
Baby, take a look around
