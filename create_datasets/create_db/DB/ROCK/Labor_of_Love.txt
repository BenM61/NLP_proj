Smoke stack blowing, there's a fire in the sky
Fahrenheit rising, oh, higher than high
Pressure's building up, sparks are gonna fly
I know where this is going when I look into your eyes
I know where this is going when I look into your eyes

Sweet sweat's rolling down the middle of your spine
Bodies move together, perfect rhythm and time
Baby say my name, I'll write yours in the sky
Higher than a rocket in the fourth of July
Higher than a rocket in the fourth of July
It's good, it's good, it's good to be alive

Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Yeah, everything I got, it's all about us
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love

Only fools count treasure in silver and gold
I don't want for nothing that these hands can hold
If you need something done, put it on the list
And if I need some sugar, I'll get it from your lips
If I need some sugar, I'll get it from your lips
It's good, it's good, it's good to be alive

Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Yeah, everything I got, it's all about us
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love

One taste of your lips, every night, every day
I know every curve, but it's never the same
If love is a fire, I'll go down in flames
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name
I wanna die in your arms, hearing you say my name

Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Yeah, everything I got, it's all about us
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Its a full time job, the work's never done
Twenty-four seven, it's a labor of love
Give everything I've got, I can't get enough
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
Baby this ain't working, it's a labor of love
