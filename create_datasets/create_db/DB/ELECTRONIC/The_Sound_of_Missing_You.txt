I miss hearing your voice
All the words that you said to me
But now this empty space fills me up and takes over me
And I can't escape it

It always keeps coming back
The sound of missing you
I hear it all around
The sound of missing you
The silence is so loud
The sound of missing you

I can't break through these walls 
That are rising in front of me
And the deeper I fall
I realize I never gonna be free
Baby release me

It always keeps coming back
The sound of missing you
I hear it all around
The sound of missing you
The silence is so loud
The sound of missing you

Time goes by and it feels like
I'm just going out of my mind
What we had
Bring it back now
'Cause I'm feeling empty inside
Oh, times goes by and it feels like 
I'm just going out of my mind
What we had
Bring it back now
Cause I'm feeling empty inside

It always keeps coming back
The sound of missing you
I hear it all around
The sound of missing you
The silence is so loud

Yeah
I miss hearing your voice
All the words that you said to me
Oh I need you
But now this empty space fills me up and takes over me

Hey
Baby release me
I can't break through these walls
They are rising in front of me
It always keeps coming back
The sound of missing you
And the deeper I fall
I realize I never gonna be free
I hear it all around
The sound of missing you
I can't break through these walls
They are rising in front of me
The silence is so loud

The sound of missing you
The sound of missing you
The sound of missing you
