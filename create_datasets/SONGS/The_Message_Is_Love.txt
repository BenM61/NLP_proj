All around the world there are people crying
Can't find something to believe
They put so much faith in people who are lying
They're so easy to deceive
It ain't no mystery, you know the words to set you free
There for all the world to see
When you got it on your side
There's no reason left to hide
You've got to give it to receive

The message is love
Love is the message and the message is love
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above
Tell everybody
Tell everybody what you're dreaming of
Tell them love is the message and the message is love

Deep in every heart there, is on answer
What will it take to make it real?
Even a soul behind a wall of confusion
Still can tell you what you feel

Why must it be the sight of something burning in the night
To make us hunger for the day
It ain't no mystery, just love enough to let it be
Everybody knows the way

The message is love
Love is the message and the message is love
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above
Tell everybody
Tell everybody what you're dreaming of
Tell them love is the message and the message is love

Can't you hear the sound? Must be the earth spinning 'round
We're gonna find out just what the world is all about

The message is love
Love is the message and the message is love
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above
Tell everybody
Tell everybody what you're dreaming of
Tell them love is the message and the message is love
