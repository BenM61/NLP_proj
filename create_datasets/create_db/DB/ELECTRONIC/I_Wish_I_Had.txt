Yeah
Every stone that's turned
Every lesson learnt
Every moment fixed up always
Can you find what's lost?
Realize the cost?
Undermining the boss just don't pay
Every image flash
For the excess cash
Every road that's leading nowhere
It's the line you follow
Cream you swallow
Hate gets hollow always
And you still won't stop
Running till you drop
Thinking you might reach
The sky
(The sky)
So the only question left
To ask is why
Why (x2)
I wish I had a gun
So I could get wasted
Sometimes you win
And sometimes you lose
Sometimes there's nowhere left you can run to
And if I had a gun
I'd want to get wasted
One day it's hard
The next time it's cool
Sometimes there's nowhere left you can run to
Every mourning wake
Every demon shake
Gonna come full circle someday
Every buried past
Every time the last
But it just don't wash up no way
All the shameful waste
For the stone you crave
Every guess you hazard, gone
And the only road you know
Is further on
On (x2)
Yeah
I wish I had a gun
So I could get wasted
Sometimes you win
And sAometimes you lose
Sometimes there's nowhere left you can run to
And if I had a gun
I'd want to get wasted
One day it's hard
The next time it's cool
Sometimes there's nowhere left you can run to
Every powder trip
Every girl you slip
Underneath, it's over one day
For the great white lie
You hide
Then you die
I wish I had a gun
So I could get wasted
(So I could get wasted)
Sometimes you win
And sometimes you lose
Sometimes there's nowhere left you can run to
(Oh, yeah)
And if I had a gun
(Stone free)
I'd want to get wasted
(As free as the wind blows)
One day it's hard
(As free as the rocks glow)
The next time it's cool
(Stone free) (x2)
Sometimes there's nowhere left you can run to
(x8) Yes, this is free
(I wish I had a gun)
Stone free (x8)
