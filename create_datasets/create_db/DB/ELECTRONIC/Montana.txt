Panic start it's 8o'clock 28 
Mach 10 to get to the school on time 
Throw a dress on over my head 
Jump in my freedom ride 

Fill me up with sound 
The world sings with me a million smiles an hour 
I can see me dancing on my radio 
I can hear you singing in the blades of grass 

Yellow dandelions on my way to school 
Big Beautiful Sky! 

Panic start it's just enough, a little, too late 
Park calls! 
I'll not go to school today 
Throw a bright pink dress over my red head 

Go to Saint Mary's Lake 
Fill me up with sound 
The world sings with me a million smiles an hour 
I can see me dancing on my radio 

I can hear you singing in the blades of grass 
Yellow dandelions on my way to school 
Big Beautiful Sky!
