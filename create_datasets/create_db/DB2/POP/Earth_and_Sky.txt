Late last night, did I dream?
Over the hill and far away
They wanted to live in pleasure
They wanted to live above the plains

Holier than thou, banking on a cloud
Never coming down to earth and sky

Did I dream, so late at night?
I saw dinosaurs and sabre tooth
Gambling with the treasure

Holier than thou, banking on a cloud
Never coming down to earth and sky
Down to earth and sky

I awake, I awake
I think I'm safe in my room
All my fading dreams just take a bow
They're bending before the future

Holier than thou, banking on a cloud
Never coming down to earth and sky
Earth and sky, earth and sky, earth and sky
