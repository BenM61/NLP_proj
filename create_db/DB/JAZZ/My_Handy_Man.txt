Whoever said a good man was hard to find, 
Positively, absolutely sure was blind; 
I found the best that ever was, 
Here's just some of the things he does: 
He shakes my ashes, greases my griddle, 
Churns my butter, strokes my fiddle; 
My man is such a handy man! 
He threads my needle, creams my wheat, 
Heats my heater, chops my meat; 
My man is such a handy man! 
Don't care if you believe or not, 
He sure is good to have around; 
Why, when my furnace gets too hot, 
He's right there to turn my damper down! 
For everything he's got a scheme; 
You ought to see his new starter that he uses on my machine; 
My man is such a handy man! 
He flaps my flapjacks, cleans off the table, He feeds the horses in my stable; My man is such a handy man! 
He's God's gift! 
Sometimes he's up long before dawn, 
Busy trimming the rough edges off my lawn; 
Oooh, you can't get away from it! He's such a handy man! 
Never has a single thing to say, 
While he's working hard; 
I wish that you could see the way 
He handles my front yard! 
My ice don't get a chance to melt away, 
He sees that I get that old fresh piece every day; 
Lord, that man sure is such a handy man
