Oh... 
Imajin 
'98 
What? 
Can you keep a secret 
Cause I can 
Hay hay hay 
If you won't tell 
Then I won't tell 
Ohh 
Keep it to yourself what? 

Keep it to yourself 
Don't tell nobody else 
No matter what we do 
It says between me and you 

Keep it to yourself 
Don't tell nobody else 
No matterc what we do 
It stays between me and you 

Don't tell your sister 
Or your bestfriend 
What we did last night 
Try to keep it inside 
Cause if they knew they would'nt 
Keep it to themselves 
(They'd be talkin' bout) 
How they heard it from the horse's mouth 
So... 

Keep it to yourself 
Don't tell nobody else 
No matter what we do 
It says between me and you 

Keep it to yourself 
Don't tell nobody else 
No matterc what we do 
It stays between me and you 

Verse 2 (Olamide) 

Don't whisper secrets across the way 
Because you (never know) 
Who knows who and where they've been 
Cause what they don't know they wonder about 
And what they can't see they lie about 
All I want is privacy 
Me lovin' you and you lovin' me 

If I give my heart to you 
And do the things you waant me to 
Would you kiss and tell 
(Would you kiss and tell no, no, no, no) 

Baby if I give my heart to you 
Would you keep your word to me 

Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else. 
Keep it to yourself 
Don't tell nobody else 
No matter what we do 
It says between me and you 

Keep it to yourself 
Don't tell nobody else 
No matterc what we do 
It stays between me and you 

Baby I'll do what you want to do 
I got so much love for you 
And it's just the kinda thing 
I want to keep between us two 
I want to keep between us two 

Keep it to yourself 
Don't tell nobody else 
No matter what we do 
It says between me and you 

Keep it to yourself 
Don't tell nobody else 
No matter what we do 
It stays between me and you
