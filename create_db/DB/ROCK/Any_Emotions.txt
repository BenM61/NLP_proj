Beautiful creature
Head in the sand
I stand at the alter
Cry on command

Ooo you could be happy
But I don't understand any emotions

Negative Nancy (negative Nancy)
High in demand (high in demand)
The cards on the table (the cards on the table)
I'll show you my hand (I'll show you my hand)

Ooo you could be angry
But I don't understand any emotions

Down on the corner
Nothing to lose
Man out of order
Just bad news

Ooo you could be lonely
But I don't understand any emotions

Any emotions

Any emotions

Any emotions

So happy
So happy
So happy
So happy
You sound
You

So happy
So happy
So happy
So happy
You
