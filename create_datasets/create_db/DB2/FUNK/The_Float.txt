I'm a spaceman
Sent from the moon
Shot off a missole
And heard this tune

Let's float, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Baby, let's float

Now lift your arms
Just like a bird
And listen for
The magic word

Let's float, oh, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Baby, let's float, hey now

Now watch those
Planets go whizzing by
Float with me
We're going up high

Let's float, oh, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Baby, let's float
Come on, baby, come on

Mercury, Mars
And Venus too
Float with me
That's the thing to do

Let's float, oh
Come on, baby, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Come on, let's float

Now my missile
Is down to earth
I'm floating for
All I'm worth

Let's float, come on now
Baby, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Baby, let's float

Come on, baby, let's go
Let's float, come on, baby
Let's float, woo

Let's float, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Baby, let's float

Let's float
Raise your hands high
Let's float
Come on, real high
