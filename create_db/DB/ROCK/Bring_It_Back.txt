Saturday, past September
In the jailhouse, I remember 
I got caught with too much soul
Bringing it back from Mexico
Bringing it back from Mexico
Spanish lights and pretty faces
Trip you out to where the place is
Load you up and let you go

Bringing it back from Mexico
Bringing it back from Mexico
Across the border is where you get her
The wine's good, there ain't no better
I think I'll get me some to go
Bringing it back from Mexico
Bringing it back from Mexico
