It comes and slowly stains my heart 
That's been cold, all alone and so tightly closed 
The sins are scattered everywhere 
They're around me 
I can't see it 
It vainly comes just crashing down 
In this sad and forgotten little town 
The truth we tend to look the other way from lies down deep 

I open out my wings of glass 
Up and towards the wind melted future 
So just please don't go 
Please don't go 
Be close to you 

I lay my hand on top of the heavy and closed-out door and I pray 
The lonely future left for me is one meaning of just living 
It comes and slowly stains my heart 
That's been cold, all alone and so tightly closed 
The sins are scattered everywhere 
They're around me 
I can't see it 
It vainly comes just crashing down 
In this sad and forgotten little town 
The truth we tend to look the other way from lies down deep 

I open out my wings of glass 
Up and towards the wind melted future 
So just please don't go 
Please don't go 
Wanna be close to you 
I'm now forgetting even the colors of your tears and love 
So just please don't go 
Please don't go 
Holding on strong to what lies ahead 

I bleed as my way of compensating everything to you 
How heavy is blood? 
Happiness and sadness lies too close 

The hand of the child born tomorrow will be just pure and nothing else 
I can barely see you with all these tears 

I open out my wings of glass 

Up and towards the wind melted future 
So just please don't go 
Please don't go 
Wanna be close to you 
I'm now forgetting even the colors of your tears and love 
So just please don't go 
Please don't go 
Holding on strong to what lies ahead 

The bells of reality rings out loudly from down deep within 
And disappears along with all the wind
