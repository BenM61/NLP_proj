Ooh baby I hear you spend night time
Wrapped like candy in a blue blue neon glow
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
Ooh baby watchful lines vibrate soft in brainwave time

Silver pictures move so slow
Golden tubes faintly glow
Electric faces seem to merge
Hidden voices mock your words

Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
The beams become my dream
My dream is on the screen
The beams become my dream
My dream is on the screen

Dusty frames that still arrive die in 1955
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate

The beams become my dream
My dream is on the screen
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
