Love is like a window pane
The sun shines in, but it stops the rain
They say that love is blind
To me this is so true
The day the world turned blue

A pill, i thought everything was funny
A pill, and i thought our walks were sunny
Look what they've done to you
I swear i never knew
The day the world turned blue
The day the world turned blue...
