Keep those under our belts to blaze you up
E'ry day we play with, the latest trucks
Work that tip chronic on the porch well

Don't get rat-a-tat tatted up, it be a bad look
Be wettin' your pants when bullets hit, mad shook
Droppin' your gun and all that, you mad puss
34 shell cases fall in one push

You get beaten and battered up, y'all little chain snapped
We still takin' 'em, f*ck it let the team have it
Be droppin' your drinks, trippin' on things scramblin'
It be chaos when guns ring at him
