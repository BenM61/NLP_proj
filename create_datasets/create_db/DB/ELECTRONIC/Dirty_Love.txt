Drop that dirty love
Drop that dirty love
Drop that dirty love
I just can't get enough

Drop that dirty love
Drop that dirty love
Drop that dirty love
I just can't get enough

Begging for the bass-line
Dancing till it's daytime
Heard it through the grapevine
We want it now
Come a little closer
Maximum exposure
Like a roller-coaster
About to go down
About to go down

Drop that dirty love
Drop that dirty love
Drop that dirty love
I just can't get enough

Begging for the bass-line
Dancing till it's daytime
Heard it through the grapevine
We want it now
Come a little closer
Maximum exposure
Like a roller-coaster
About to go down
About to go down

Drop that dirty love
Drop that dirty love
Drop that dirty love
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

Begging for the bass-line
Dancing till it's daytime
Heard it through the grapevine
We want it now
Come a little closer
Maximum exposure
Like a roller-coaster
About to go down
About to go down

Drop that dirty love
Drop that dirty love
Drop that dirty love
I just can't get enough

Begging for the bass-line
Dancing till it's daytime
Heard it through the grapevine
We want it now
Come a little closer
Maximum exposure
Like a roller-coaster
About to go down
