And I know whenever you are feeling down
You gotta have, gotta have, you gotta have rock and roll
I know that if you even pick me up
When you gotta have, gotta have, you gotta have rock and roll

Someday when you ever break free
Feeling so down, feeling so down!
Well I know our love is always,
Heading for the wind, heading for the wind!

And I know whenever you are feeling down
You gotta have, gotta have, you gotta have rock and roll
I know that if you even pick me up
When you gotta have, gotta have, you gotta have rock and roll

Someday when you ever break free
Feeling so down, feeling so down!
Well I know our love is always,
Heading for the wind, heading for the wind!
And no, I never knew oh, oh. 
I know I never knew, oh, oh, oh
