Keep your distance 
I haven't got a thing to say
Where's the exit? 
What time is it anyway?
You said there was gonna be a party
But I don't see a thing
Where's this happening, in your head?

Still, you better wear a smile when they watch you
Smile like you're in control
Smile like you mean it
Smile, baby, you're on a roll
Smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile

What's the matter with you people? 
Can't I even get a drink in here?
There's something evil going on in this place
But what it is ain't exactly clear
Everybody's making jokes in French
Nobody dances, nobody sweats
But they x-ray every inch of your flesh as you walk by

And they say you gotta smile when they watch you
Smile like you're in control
Smile like you mean it
Smile, baby, you're on a roll
Smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile

Yeah, you only got to smile when they watch you
Smile like you're in control
Smile like you mean it
Smile, baby, you're on a roll
Smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile
