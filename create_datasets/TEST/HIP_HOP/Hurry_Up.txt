You're talking, you're talking so much
I don't believe what you sayin'

If it's me, hurry up, what it be, hurry up
I been waiting all night for you just to please tear it up
If it?s really the rhythm just let me see, hurry up
And by the way, I like ?em bigger than boys, don't disappoint me

If it's me, hurry up, what it be, hurry up

Click my heels and I blink two times
You're getting only three or four more seconds of mine
And I wonder why your questions always ending in why
Well, it's just because that all you do is wasting my time

Now I told you how I feel, that you got an appeal
That I can somehow can see myself wanting to chill with
If you don't hit real hard like a big speaker
Then wait this one out ?cause you didn't hurry up

If it's me hurry up, what it be, hurry up
I been waiting all night for you just to please tear it up
If it?s really the rhythm just let me see, hurry up
And by the way, I like ?em bigger than boys, don't disappoint me

I been waiting all night for you just to please tear it up
If it?s really the rhythm just let me see, hurry up
And by the way, I like ?em bigger than boys, don't disappoint me

All I feel is warm sensations
And your conversation just can't get me, babe
Didn't I tell you that time was ticking?
And I let it change hey

If it's me, hurry up, what it be, hurry up
I been waiting all night for you just to please tear it up
If it?s really the rhythm just let me see, hurry up
And by the way, I like ?em bigger than boys, don't disappoint me

If it's me, hurry up, what it be, hurry up
I been waiting all night for you just to please tear it up
If it?s really the rhythm just let me see, hurry up
And by the way, I like ?em bigger than boys, don't disappoint me

Now all my girls know we like ?em ripped up
If it doesn't hurt if he's chipped up
You got a little bit off both of them but listen
You didn't like hurry like I told you so you gets none

We like ?em ripped, we like ?em ripped, we like ?em ripped all up
We like ?em chipped, we like ?em chipped, we like ?em chipped all up
You got me, you got ?em both but you weren't listening
Is there any boys around here with a spitfire?
