Seems my life
Is finally coming together
Don't think I've ever been better
It's clear to me

My future will bring
The peace I've been living for will be mine
Forever more

It's a new day
Open my eyes and the path is clearer
It's a new day
Pushin' ahead til my goal is nearer
It's a new day
Spread my wings
I'm doin' things my way
It's a new day

Made the same mistakes
Over and again
Now it's time
For the illusion to end

For every door that shuts
Another opens
Takin' a chance I'm gonna win
Can't go back where I've been

It's a new day
Open my eyes and the path is clearer
It's a new day
Pushin' ahead til my goal is nearer
It's a new day
Spread my wings
I'm doin' things my way
It's a new day

I'm excited for the things
Ahead of me
I decided I can make it
On my own 

Embrace the good and bad
And let go of the past
I'm loving what's inside of me

It's a new day
Open my eyes and the path is clearer
It's a new day
Pushin' ahead til my goal is nearer
It's a new day
Spread my wings
I'm doin' things my way
It's a new day
