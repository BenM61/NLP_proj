You come alive at quarter to three
You make haste for a taste 
In the parking lot of misery
So down it goes
And up goes your need 
So you're fine for the time
But you're on the line
Not in between
What can this stuff do to me?
Apothecary, some more of the same today
Fills that need
You're late again for chemistry class
You were up in the lab 
With your chemical head in a flask 
The truth is though
Your mind is a mess
You've just taken a dose
Now you're comatose in Pandora's chest
How could I do this to me?
Apothecary, oh please
Where's the antidote?
For me 
Looking for ways you can let it out 
Sleep in the days
For tonight you'll roam about
Pull all the stops
You begin to shout
Life's a big dream and you sleep
Till you come out
Come out 
Fill my need
Apothecary
Fill my need
Apothecary
