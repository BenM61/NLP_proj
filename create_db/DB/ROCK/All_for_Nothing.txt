I have given up the demons
I've made up a hundred reasons
I have turned my back on everything I knew
I have justified my actions
Been denying satisfaction
I believe tonight I've pulled away the truth

All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you

I have lost the inhibitions
I have felt a deep contrition
And I've realized there's still so much to do
I was lost inside my own lies
I felt victim and I thought I
Would never find the strength to do what I must do

All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you

I've been inside hell and out of
I've done things I'm less than proud of
I have only ever tried to get to you
I've lost everything and still have
Never given up until I either die
Or I will make it back to you

All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you
All to be with you

All to be with you

All to be with you
