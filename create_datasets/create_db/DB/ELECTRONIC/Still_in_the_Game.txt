Here's to gamblers
Who hold to the game
Through the hard times
They don't lose their aim
And they hope for time on their side
And they keep a ticket to ride

They keep watching for signs in the land
They keep watching for signs in the land
And they stand there watching the sky
And they stand there ready to fly

Here's to never letting go
Though sometimes it does get lonely

I still walk out in the morning light
Just to see what is there
I hear music in silent nights
Searching I find a reason to care
One heart moving still the same
Still in the game

Here's to lovers who reach for it all
Never matching the rise with the fall
And they just can't leave it alone
And they want it all till it's gone
Here's to players who can't leave their song
And it haunts them
Their night is so long
Cause there's music there in their mind
From a world they're trying to find

Here's to never letting go
Though sometimes it does get lonely
