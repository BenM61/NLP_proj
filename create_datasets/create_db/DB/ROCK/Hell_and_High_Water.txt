I know your hiding places
And I know your every move
'Cause, girl, I've been lonely too
And I seen a million faces
Been to a million places
But, girl, there's no one quite like you

And I've gone through Hell and high water
Washed away with the tide
I can lose a damn war all by myself
If you were on the other side
So, in the morning when the rooster crows
Pack your bags and get ready to go
If you're walkin' through Hell and high water, please don't do it alone

I know you feel let down
And I know you've been turned out
I wish I'd been there for you
So when the nighttime comes around
And you feel like an only child
Just know I'll be there for you

And I've gone through Hell and high water
Washed away with the tide
I can lose a damn war all by myself
If you were on the other side
So, in the morning when the rooster crows
Pack your bags and get ready to go
If you're walkin' through Hell and high water, please don't do it alone

And I've gone through Hell and high water
Washed away with the tide
I can lose a damn war all by myself
If you were on the other side
So, in the morning when the rooster crows
Pack your bags and get ready to go
If you're walkin' through Hell and high water, please don't do it alone

If you're walkin' through Hell and high water, please don't do it alone
Oh, no
