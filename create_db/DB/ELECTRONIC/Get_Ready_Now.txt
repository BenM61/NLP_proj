I'm the one who makes you shine
Look what's right it's all inside
Baby, it's the time to fuse
What you got, you gotta lose

Tell me baby, what you do?
What you got, you gotta lose
Waiting to it just get over
The shiny road, road to nowhere

What's down on your knees
For the sake of your soul

Get ready now
Get ready now
Get ready now
Get ready now

Get ready now
I am in this dump for you
I am in this dump for you
I am in this dump for you
Right with you

I'm the one who makes you shine
Look what's mine it's all inside
Maybe it's time to fuse
What you got, you gotta lose

What's down on your knees
For the sake of your soul

Get ready now
Get ready now
Get ready,
Get ready, get ready
Get ready, get ready
Get ready, get ready
Get ready, get ready
Get ready, get ready

Get ready now
Get ready now
Get ready now
Get ready now
Now, now, now, now
I am in this dump for you
I am in this dump for you
I am in this dump for you
Right with you

I'm the one who makes you shine
Look what's mine it's all inside
Maybe is it time to fuse
What you got, you gotta lose

Get ready
Get ready

Get ready, now
I am in this dump for you
(Now)
