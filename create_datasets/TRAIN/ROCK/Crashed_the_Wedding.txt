I'm so rushed off my feet
Looking for Gordon Street
So much I need to say
I'm sorry that it's on her wedding day
Cause she's so right for me
Her daddy disagrees
He's always hated me
Because I never got a J-O-B

Cause she's mine
And I'm glad I Crashed the Wedding
It's better than regretting
I could have been a loser kid
Ran away and hid
But it's the best thing that I ever did
Cause true love last's forever
And now we're back together
It's as if he'd never met her

So looking back
I'm glad I Crashed the Wedding
The neighbors spread the word
And my mum cried when she heard
I stole my girl away from everybody gathered there that day
Just in time
And I'm glad I Crashed the Wedding
It's better than regretting
I could have been a loser kid

Ran away and hid
I said I'd do it and I did
Cause true love lasts forever
And now we're back together
It's as if he'd never met her
So looking back
I'm glad I Crashed the Wedding
Don't wish she's being Mad at me for taking her away 
'cause anyway she didn't want to stay 
So please believe me when I say 
She's glad I crashed the wedding
It's better than regretting
