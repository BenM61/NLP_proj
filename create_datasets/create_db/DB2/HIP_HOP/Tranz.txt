Oscillate yourself tonight
When you're in your bed
Assimilate the dopamine
Passing through your head

When you get back on a Saturday night
And your head is caving in
Do you look like me, do you feel like me
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this?
Forever

See yourself with cupid's flame
Chipped in your head
Pay them a cake, the satellites
Passing by the edge

When you get back on a Saturday night
And your head is caving in
Do you look like me, do you feel like me
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this?
Forever
Do you dance like this?
Forever

Do you look like me
Do you burn like me
Do you look like me
Do you burn like me
Do you look like me
Do you burn like me
Do you turn into your effigy?

Do you dance like this?
Forever
Do you live like this?
Forever
