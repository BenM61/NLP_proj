I've been down the Mississippi, down through New Orleans
I've played in California there ain't too much I haven't seen
I'm a Ramblin' Man
Don't fool around with a Ramblin' Man

Left a girl in West Virginia
Up there where the green grass grows
Got a girl in Cincinnati, waitin' where the Ohio River flows
I'm a Ramblin' Man
Don't give your heart to a Ramblin' Man

You better move away
You're standing too close to the flame
Once I mess with your mind
Your little heart won't be the same

I'm a Ramblin' Man
Don't mess around with a Ramblin' Man

Well, up in Chicago I was known as quite a boy
Down in Alabama they call me the man of joy
I'm a Ramblin' Man
Don't fall in love with a Ramblin' Man

You better move away
You're standing too close to the flame
Once I mess with your mind
Your little heart won't be the same

I'm a Ramblin' Man
Don't mess around with a Ramblin' Man
