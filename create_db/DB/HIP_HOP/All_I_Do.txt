Ah, yo, roll the track, uh, yeah
Kick, stick, ah, stare, vocals, ah, yeah

It doesn't matter, what time of the day
Ask me what I'm thinkin' about and it's you that I'm gonna say
Twenty-four seven, fifty-two, three sixty-five
Just wanted you to know how you stay on my mind, yeah

All I do is think of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Everyday, every night, yeah)
All I do is speak of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(I can't keep it to myself, no)
All I do is dream of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Dreams of you every night, yeah)
All I do is think of you, baby, all the time
(All the time, all the time)

You've got somethin' special, worthy of my love
And I don't wanna let go, just keep on holdin' on
Oh, you got me goin', thoughts of me and you
And I can't help but talk about all the sexy things you do

All I do is think of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Hey, all the time, oh)
All I do is speak of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(You stay on my mind, oh, baby)
All I do is dream of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Dreams of you and I makin' love again, baby, yeah)
All I do is think of you, baby, all the time
(All the time and it don't stop)

(And it won't stop)
The kissin' and the lovin'
The things you do to me, you keep me satisfied
(And it don't stop)
Let me give you my lovin'
Let me show you how much that I think about you every night

All I do is think of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Hey)
All I do is speak of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Oh, my mind, on my mind)
All I do is dream of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Dreams of you and I, yeah)
All I do is think of you, baby, all the time
(All the time, all the time)

Now, now, now
I gotta admit but you got me trippin' a bit last week
I caught you 6 times in one day
I was like damn, baby, got me open a lil' some, some
But that's how good, 'cause you got a waist like a wasp
But a ass like a hoss

Feels so good, got a nigga calling you boss now
To the end to the floor of my bed, that's right
Shit is tight like a man sittin' on dubs
That's what it was and that's what it's gonna be

You know that I'm your freak
Call me up any time of the week
Before so I could come over there
And put it down like a nigga supposed to
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' bout

All I do is think of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(All I do is think of you twenty-four seven)
All I do is speak of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Fifty-two, three sixty-five)
All I do is dream of you, honey, you stay on my mind
All I do is think of you, baby, all the time
(All I do is think of you everyday now)

All I do is think of you, honey, you stay on my mind
All I do is speak of you, honey, you stay on my mind
All I do is dream of you, honey, you stay on my mind
All I do is think of you, baby, all the time

All I do is think of you, honey, you stay on my mind
All I do is speak of you, honey, you stay on my mind
All I do is dream of you, honey, you stay on my mind
All I do is think of you, baby, all the time

All I do is think of you, honey, you stay on my mind
