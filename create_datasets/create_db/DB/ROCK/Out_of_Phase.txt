You never listen in to what they know
They only play the songs you've always known
Can replace the roll of fifty nine
As you are and always were in love that time

You're unsure of the marriage vow
Lived it once, and in it hide you now,
The morning ash the fire of sixty nine
Will remain with you and hope for better times

Out of phase
Will you always be
Out of phase
Getting back to me
Out of phase, out of phase

Finding love, you go to memories
Hold on tight, romantic hearts are near
Going somewhere, is there anywhere
That smiles aloud, a place where all are proud.

Out of phase
Will you always be
Out of phase
Getting back to me
Out of phase, out of phase

Looking around me
You're not the only one
Looking for something old
Looking for something done

Out of phase, out of phase
Out of phase, out of phase
Wo oh oh wo oh oh

Out of phase
Will you always be
Out of phase
Getting back to me

Out of phase, out of phase
Never seeing, never saying who you are
Don't conform to them
You're better as you are,
Out of phase, out of phase...
