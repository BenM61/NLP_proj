We could fool the datelines
We could jump the statelines
I don't wanna always play nice
But I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heart

Have you been let down by the ones before?
Do you leave too soon to know?
Never fell in love 'cause I just cut loose
But not when it comes to you

Dressing in black, you're around for the weekend
Dancing at night, you're the light that I won't let go
And I want you close

We could fool the datelines
We could jump the statelines
I don't wanna always play nice
But I wanna feel your heartlines
I'll pick you up at midnight
We'll run to beat the sunlight
We only get the one life
And I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heart

Now we're far apart, in and out of touch
And the words don't mean as much
So I sit across from someone new
But they don't compare to you

Lying in bed wide awake, I remember
Dancing at night, you're the light that I won't let go
And I want you close

We could fool the datelines
We could jump the statelines
I don't wanna always play nice
But I wanna feel your heartlines
I'll pick you up at midnight
We'll run to beat the sunlight
We only get the one life
And I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heartlines

Lying in bed wide awake, I remember
I feel
Dressing in black, you were here for the weekend
And I won't let go
'Cause I want you close

We could fool the datelines
We could jump the statelines
I don't wanna always play nice
But I wanna feel your heartlines
I'll pick you up at midnight
We'll run to beat the sunlight
We only get the one life
And I wanna feel your heartlines
We could fool the datelines
We could jump the statelines
I don't wanna always play nice
But I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heart
