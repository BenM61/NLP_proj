Hodad made the scene
Totin' a six-pack of cold cola
A stogie smokin' in hand
A groovin' in his sandals

California's on my mind
Surf and sand setting in the sun
California's on my mind
One day you're gonna be
A place in our memory

When Woody hit the dunes
Flying foxtails and Old Glory
Rubber ripped the sand
He gunned a souped-down Stingray

Ah, California
She's in Mythical Malibu
Sitting on the ocean
Goodbye Mythical Malibu
The San Andreas Mifortune
Will claim the lives of sons and wives
The headlines will fill page after page

California's on my mind
Surf and sand setting in the sun
In the sun, in the sun
In the setting sun

One day you're gonna be one sweet memory
Oh yeah, California
Swinging on the beach
To the sounds of their time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
