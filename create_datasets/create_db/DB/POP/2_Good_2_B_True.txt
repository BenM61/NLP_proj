Want to make a connection
Cause I know we're gonna take 'em high
And I'll show you how to rip up a kicker
If that's alright
 
The way you're ridin' the half pipe
There is somethin' 'bout the look in your eye
Hey, girl, why don't you show me a trick or two?
Come, let it fly
 
(Gonna twist now, gonna take you on a ride, gonna get along, gonna get along fine, I got the skills if you got the style)
You do it for me
It's the way you smile, girl
(Take people home, to a hip hop beat, knock me down, knock me off my feet, whip one up, let's get on with the show)
Ooo, you're the way to go
 
[Chorus]
It's too good to be true
Now I'm ridin' with you
It's too bad to believe
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't want to come back down 
It's too good to be true
 
Okay, it's not like I'm short of a girlfriend (yeah right)
But I'm playin' with my plan on attack
Cause I know that once you've checked out my lip slide
You ain't lookin' back
 
(Gonna twist now, gonna take you on a ride, gonna get along, gonna get along fine, I got the skills if you got the style)
You do it for me
It's the way you smile, girl
(Take people home, to a hip hop beat, knock me down, knock me off my feet, whip one up, let's get on with the show)
Ooo, you're the way to go

[Chorus]
 
I ride all day, even in the sun
Boilin' hot, but I still have fun
Everybody's watchin', keepin' their eye
On how I skate, how I fly
Ridin' the rails, hittin' the ramps
I'll skate all day, gonna hafta camp
Although I get tired, it doesn't stop me
Hey, bettah watch me
 
(Gonna twist now, gonna take you on a ride, gonna get along, gonna get along fine, I got the skills if you got the style)
You do it for me
It's the way you smile, girl
(Take people home, to a hip hop beat, knock me down, knock me off my feet, whip one up, let's get on with the show)
Ooo, you're the way to go

[Chorus]

And I don't want to come back down
It's too good to be true
