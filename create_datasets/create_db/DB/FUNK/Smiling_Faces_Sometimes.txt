Smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend.
Smiling faces show no traces of the evil that lurks within.
 
Smiling faces, Smiling Faces, Sometimes they don't tell the truth.
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof.
The truth is in the eye 'cause the eyes don't lie, amen.
Remember, a smile is just a frown turned upside down my friend.
So, hear me when I'm saying
 
Smiling faces, Smiling Faces, Sometimes they don't tell the truth.
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof.
Beware.  Beware of the handshake that hides the snake, 
I'm tellin' you beware of the pat on the back it just might hold you back.
Jealousy, (Jealousy)  misery, (misery) envy.
I tell you you can't see behind
 
Smiling faces, Smiling Faces, Sometimes they don't tell the truth.
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof.
Your enemy won't do you no harm, 'cause you'll know where he's comin' from;
don't let the handshake and the smile fool ya.
Take my advice I'm only tryin' to school ya.
 
Smiling faces, Smiling Faces, Sometimes they don't tell the truth.
