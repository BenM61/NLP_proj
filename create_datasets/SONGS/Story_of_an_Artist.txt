Listen up and I'll tell a story
About an artist growing old
Some would try for fame and glory
Others aren't so bold

Everyone in friends and family
Sayin "hey get a job
Why do you only do that only
Why are you so odd?

"We don't really like what you do
We don't think anyone ever will
It's a problem that you have
And this problem's made you ill"

Listen up and I'll tell a story
About an artist growing old
Some would try for fame and glory
Others aren't so bold

The artist walks alone
Someone says behind his back
"He's got his gall to call himself that
He doesn't even know where he's at"

The artist walks among the flowers
Appreciating the sun
He does this all his waking hours
But is it really so wrong

They sit in front of their tv
Sayin "hey this is fun"
And they laugh at the artist
Saying "he doesn't know how to have fun"

The best things in life are truly free
Singing birds and laughing bees
You got me wrong says he
The sun don't shine in your tv

Some would try for fame and glory
Others aren't so bold

Everyone in friends and family
Sayin' "hey get a job
Why do you only do that only
Why are you so odd?

"We don't really like what you do
We don't think anyone ever will
It's a problem that you have
And this problem's made you ill"

Listen up and I'll tell a story
About an artist growin' old
Some would try for fame and glory
Others just like to watch the world
