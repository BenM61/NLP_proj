Do you remember me?
Do you remember anything?
Don't pretend I didn't make you laugh
File it under fun from the past

Well, I'm looking 'round the room
Some of the people I've loved
Guess I remember everything
File it under fun from the past

[Chorus]
I could have been a contender - a contender for your love
I would have given you everything if I only knew how
I would have given you everything if I only knew how, only knew how
I could have been a contender - a contender for your love
File it under fun from the past
File it under fun from the past

It was only you; it was always only you
I never saw what other people bought
I never cared what they thought
Well, I'm looking 'round the room
Some of the people I've loved
Guess I remember everything
File it under fun from the past

[Chorus]

Do you remember me?
Do you remember anything?
Don't pretend that it'll make you laugh
File it under fun from the past

Well, I'm looking 'round the room
Some of the people I've loved
Guess I remember everything
File it under fun from the past

[Chorus]
