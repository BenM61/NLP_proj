The spark in your eye sets my soul on fire
Your voice is like a angel's above
The touch of your hand drives me insane
But baby, I want's to be loved

I'm crazy 'bout every little, thing you do
I cherish the way you hug
Your kisses so sweet, they just can't be beat
But baby, I want's to be loved

Every time I ask ya, for a date
You don't come at all or you mighty late
I ask you to dance, a little spin
You said "wait a minute, daddy, here come my friend"

I like the way you walk when you passin' by
Even when you tryin' to snub
You kill me every time you give me the eye
But baby, I want's to be loved

Every time I ask ya, for a date
You don't come at all or you mighty late
I ask you to dance, a little spin
You said "wait a minute, daddy, here come my friend"

I like the way you walk when you passin' by
Even when you tryin' to snub
You kill me every time you give me the eye
But baby, I want's to be loved
