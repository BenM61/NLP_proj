Tell me, doctor, where are we going this time
Is this the 50's, or 1999
All I wanted to do, was play my guitar and sing

So take me away, I don't mind
But you better promise me, I'll be back in time
Gotta get back in time

Don't bet your future, on one roll of the dice
Better remember, lightning never strikes twice
Please don't drive at eighty eight, don't want to be late again

So take me away, I don't mind
But you better promise me, I'll be back in time
Gotta get back in time
Gotta get back in time
Get me back in time

Gotta get back in time
Gotta get back in time
Get back, get back

Get back Marty
Gotta get back in time
Gotta get back in time
Get back, get back
