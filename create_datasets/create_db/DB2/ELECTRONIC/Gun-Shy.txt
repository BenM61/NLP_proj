The sky keeps staring at me
Frozen in my tracks (Nothing else to see)
And when I move my face left
You're always standing there (A shadow I can't see)
And even then I can't trace
You're walking away

I put my ears to the ground
Always pushing down (Nothing I can hear)
I found the worst half in me
We're cut off at the knees (Can't even take a stand)
Against your words and beliefs
We didn't wanna freeze

(All of the years, leaving me here Gun-shy)
I don't want to say it all again (the pain, losing my aim)
Never seem to see (And why?)
Do I always feel it all the same
The blisters in my eyes (Recite)
A guide that has only led me stray
And even as I limp (you smile)

The cold keeps tearing at me
Slowing down my blood,(Unable to speak)
I left my mind long ago
Choosing some false (Always letting go)
And when I try to face you
You're walking away

(All of the years, leaving me here Gun-shy)
I don't want to say it all again (the pain, losing my aim)
Never seem to see
(And why?) Do I always feel it all the same
The blisters in my eyes
(Recite) A guide that has only led me stray
And even as I limp (you smile)
