How much is enough?
And who makes that call?
How much is enough?
And who makes that call?
F*ck yeah

My public word (f*ck yeah)
My private word (f*ck yeah)
A public call (f*ck yeah)
A private call (f*ck yeah)
F*ck yeah!

You can't ball the f*ck on us
I won't let that go
I'll never let that go
You can't ball the f*ck on us
I won't hide
I won't hide
I won't let that go
I'll never let that go

From the broad side
To the hidden side
From the the broad side
To the hidden side
A wall is a wall
A wall is just a wall
A wall is a wall
And nothing more at all

Am I under arrest? (f*ck it)
And do I have the right? (f*ck it)
Need I say more? (f*ck it)
And do I need to say more (f*ck it)
F*ck it

And when you see him now
I hope you see yourself, I hope you see yourself
And when you see him now
I hope you look, I hope you look
I hope you look
I hope you look

From the broad side
To the hidden side
From the the broad side
To the hidden side
A wall is a wall
A wall is just a wall
A wall is a wall
And nothing more at all
A wall is a wall
A wall is just a wall
A wall is a wall
And nothing more at all
