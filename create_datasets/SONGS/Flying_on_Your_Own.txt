You were never more strong girl
You were never more alone
Once there was two, now there's just you
Your flying on your own

You were never more happy girl
You were never oh so blue
Once heartaches begin, nobody wins
Your flying on your own

And when you know the wings you ride
Can keep you in the sky
There isn't anyone holding back you
First you stumble, then you fall
You reach out and you fly
There isn't anything that you can't do

You were never more wise girl
You were never more a fool
Once you break through, its all up to you
Your flying on your own

You were never more together
You were never more apart
Once pieces of you, were all that you knew
Your flying on your own

And when you know the wings you ride
Can keep you in the sky
There isn't anyone holding back you
First you stumble, then you fall
You reach out and you fly
There isn't anything that you can't do

And when you know the wings you ride
Can keep you in the sky
There isn't anyone holding back you
First you stumble, then you fall
You reach out and you fly
There isn't anything that you can't do
