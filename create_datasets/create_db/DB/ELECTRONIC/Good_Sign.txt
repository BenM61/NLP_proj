Yes this is a good sign
This is a good sign
Come, come, come... Ey!

It is a good sign... mh, mh, mh
Yes it is a good sign... yes
I keep feeling it
It is a good sign
Yes it is a good sign
You're my king and
I'm your queen
And everything will be so right

Baby, baby, baby
The day has begun
The butterflies are flying
And birds are singing
Can you feel the rhythm
The rhythm of the world
It's out of there waiting
Waiting for you and me

[Chorus:]
It is a good sign
Yes it is a good sign
This feeling came so suddenly
I don't know if it's right for me
But it is a good sign
Yes it is a good sign
You're my king and
I'm your queen
And everything will be so right

Baby, baby, baby
The sky is so blue
The tiny cloud
Smiling
And the sun is for you
We'll make our own music
And let the wind cool us
Honey don't you know
That this is a real life

[Chorus]

Let the phone ring
Let the ice melt
Let the bus leave
Leave the radio on

Let the phone ring
Let the ice melt
Let the music play
Leave the radio on
'Cause you know
This day is for me

Come, come, come

[Chorus]

Yes it's a good sign
Yes it is a good sign
This feeling came so suddenly
I don't know if it's right for me
It is a good sign
Come, come, come
Yes it is a good sign
Yeah

[Chorus x 2]
