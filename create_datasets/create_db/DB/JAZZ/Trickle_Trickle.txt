Trickle, Trickle, Splash, Splash
Tell me how long will this rain last
The rain keeps droppin', there ain't no stoppin',
Tell me how long will this rain last

Trickle, Trickle, Slop, Slop
Just got to see my sweet gum drop
She's there waitin' and I'm hesitatin'
Tell me just when this rain will stop

Ronnie, dig my clothes here boy,
One button low
Well, you know I'm sharp, as a tack,
Say can you lend me your Cadillac
Gotta go, gotta go to a party - yeah
Please lend me your short
Well if I can't take it,
You know I can't make it,
I won't see my baby no more.

Ronnie, she's sweet, she's fine yeh boy,
And I love her so.
Well if I don't make the party,
Man - she sure to blow.
Gotta go, gotta go to the party - yeh,
Please lend me your short,
Well if I can't take it, you know I can't make it,
I won't see my baby no more.
