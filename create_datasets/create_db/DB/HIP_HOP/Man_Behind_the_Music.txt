Step right up  step up  step up

This is how it should be done 
'Cause this style 
Is identical to none 
How can I make you dance some more 
That's what I came here for 

This is how it should be done 
(And now  here's the magnificent Funkey Mama) 
'Cause this style 
Is identical to none 
How can I make you dance some more 
That's what I came here for 

Feel your blue flows like water 
The man behind the music will make you jump 
Oh Jack you're swingin' 
Make you shake your rump 

No dick or fee tellin' me this is what you want 
Baselines and snares that will make you funk 
Intimidated by his 14 year old 
At 97 he's a different kind of funk 

We push together like a perfect hand and tongue 
You pressed your luck and now your back to should be sunk 
Be coming, free the future, with yo' face punked 
Forgot about the past now what you want 
Platinum tracks to put you on the map 

'Cause we gotta keep it in the fam' 
You had yo' chance to be down wit da man 
So busy playa hatin', perpetuating, articulating 
Balla's down four, you can't take me 

What the deal ma 
Funkey Mama plays the track so you could feel, huh? 
I'll make a D, I'm all about the dolla' bills y'all 
Rock the diamond Lex while I sit behind my desk 
And sign the checks 

If you like hits baby 
Got 'em going crazy on Blackstreet 
You know it's plaque time when me and the track meet 
Save all yo whack beats, QP and TR so precise with mics 
We should be surgeons in E.R. 

The block knows 
Baby girl be my diamond 'cause she rocks shows 
See my one's ain't no way that you can stop those 
Little man got your breath together 
With Queen Pen, now it's hot to death 

So take a look back 
What I did, what I'm doing, where I take this 
It's kinda simple 'cause it's nothing just to make hits 
Peep the facts, keep 'em stacked 
When the streets are Black 
Ladies scream he's the Mack 

'Cause I kick (what) 
Shit that make the fly chick you with my chick 
And plush funds just ridiculous 
'Cause I'm rich 
We are TR, you see, QP, that's we, Blackstreet, gone 

You can't take it 
(And now, here's the magnificent Funkey Mama) 

Now Teddy jam for me one time 
Enforce that then I'd make my hips bump and grind 
We'll just happen 
All this shit in this 'cause of platinum hits 
Little man be the shit, Funkey Mama represent 
It ain't never been no different 

And we got witnesses 
You account for all of this shit 
Just we, and get your block knocked off 
You can keep your I-pinion till you get there 

'Cause it don't matter 
We don't follow chit chatter 
We make hits 
And calls, my situations get thick 
Ask St. Nick, about the repertoire 
For those in the past, they know who they are 

If the shoe fits, trust 
We gon' wear it 
Can we be's the baddest clique up on this planet 
We paid the cost to be boss guys 
'Cause scare money don't win money, now drop it 
 
This is how it should be done 
'Cause this style 
Is identical to none 
How can I make you dance some more 
(Little man) 
That's what I came here for
