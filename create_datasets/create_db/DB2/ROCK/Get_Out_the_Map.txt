I'm gonna clear my head
I'm gonna drink that sun

The saddest sight my eyes can see
Is that big ball of orange sinkin' slyly down the trees
Sittin' in a broken circle
While you rest upon my knee
This perfect moments will soon be leavin' me

Suzanne calls from Boston
The coffee's hot the corn is high
And that same sun that warms your heart 
Will suck the good earth dry
With everything it's opposite enough to keep you cryin'
Or keep this old world spinnin' with a twinkle in its eye

Get out the map
Get out the map and lay your finger anywhere down
We'll leave the figurin' to those we pass on our way out of town
Don't drink the water
There seems to be somethin' ailin' everyone
I'm gonna clear my head
I'm gonna drink that sun
I'm gonna love you good and strong
While our love is good and young

Joni left for South Africa a few years ago
And then Beth took a job
All the way over on the West Coast
And me, I'm still tryin' to live half a life on the road
Seems I'm heavier by the year (heavier by the year)
And heavier by the load (heavier by the load)

Why do we hurtle ourselves
Through every inch of time and space?
I must say around some corner
I can sense a restin' place
With every lesson learned
A line upon your beautiful face
We'll amuse ourselves one day
With these memories we'll trace

Get out the map
Get out the map and lay your finger anywhere down
We'll leave the figurin' to those we pass on our way out of town
Don't drink the water
There seems to be somethin' ailin' everyone
I'm gonna clear my head (I'm gonna clear my head)
I'm gonna drink that sun (I'm gonna drink that sun)
I'm gonna love you good and strong
While our love is good and young

I'm gonna clear my head
I'm gonna drink that sun
I'm gonna love you good and strong
While our love is good and young
