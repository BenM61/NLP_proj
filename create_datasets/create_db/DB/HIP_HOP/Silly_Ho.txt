I ain't never been no silly ho
Waiting for your call
Like the other girls want u
I ain't never been the one to mess
Wit' someone else's mess
That's not a thang for me to do 
I ain't never been the chicken head
To wake up in your head
After every club or two
I ain't gonna be the one in mini skirts
Always wanna flirt
Wit' every playa on the team

So if you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do

I ain't never been no silly bitch
Waiting to get rich
From a nigga bank account
I have always had my own things
Bought  my own rings
Not gonna let you catch me out
You should take a lesson from me
I ain't the one to be 
Depending on someone else
I can run a scam before he can
I'm betta than a man
I always keep my game on deck
