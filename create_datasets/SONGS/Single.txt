Ah yeah that's right 
All you single people out there 
This is for you 

I'm not waitin' around for a man to save me 
(Cos I'm happy where I am) 
Don't depend on a guy to validate me 
(No no) 
I don't need to be anyone's baby 
(Is that so hard to understand?) 
No I don't need another half to make me whole 

Make your move if you want doesn't mean I will or won't 
I'm free to make my mind up you either got it or you don't 

This is my current single status 
My declaration of independence 
There's no way I'm tradin' places 
Right now a star's in the ascendant 

I'm single 
(Right now) 
That's how I want to be 
I'm single 
(Right now) 
That's how I want to be 

Ah yeah Uh Huh that's right 

Don't need to be on somebody's arm to look good 
(I like who I am) 
I'm not saying I don't want to fall in love 'cause I would 
I'm not gonna get hooked up just 'cause you say I should 
(Can't romance on demand) 
I'm gonna wait so I'm sorry if you misunderstood 

This is my current single status 
My declaration of independence 
There's no way I'm tradin' places 
Right now a star's in the ascendant 

Everything in it's right time everything in it's right place 
I know I'll settle down one day 
But 'til then I like it this way it's my way 
Eh I like it this way 

Make your move if you want doesn't mean I will or won't 
I'm free to make my mind up you either got it or you don't 
'Til then I'm single 

This is my current single status 
My declaration of independence 
There's no way I'm tradin' places 
Right now a star's in the ascendant
