Sometime I'm thinking
Thinking about the times have been
Sometime I'm thinking
Thinking about the times have been
If you want to fall in bad
Just get your outside friends

Players can be so swell
Love can be so frail
But your outside friends
Will have you begging for it

Sometime I'm thinking
Thinking about the times, have been
If you want to fall in bad
Just get your outside friends

I have sat and watched
Evening sun go down
People saying it's sad
Not even a friend around

Sometime I'm thinking
Thinking about the times have been
If you want to fall in bad
Just get your outside friends
Play it for me

I've called and called
Hey, you know half the town
My heart pains
Salty tears come rolling down

Sometime I'm thinking
Thinking about the times have been
If you want to fall in bad
Just get your outside friends
