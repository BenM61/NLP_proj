Has love intentionally showed me that
He or she hides in a the melody
We say it's hard to find, you know that love divine we're all talking about
Well I been wasting all of my time
Cause music is my Mr. Right
And I know this love will love me right

Confused my mind with ease
It's taken over me happily, happily baby
Happily play for me, happily play for me
Happily baby, happily play for me
Play for me Charlie, play for me baby
Happily
Happily, happily
Happily baby
