We wait for you when darkness falls
The legion of the dawn
Desire burns, desire calls
The lost ones and the torn

There's a way, there's a choice so clear (so clear)
There's a place (there's a place), come here (come here)

All you, lonely souls, come
Legion of the damned
United in our pain
Together till the end
All you, lonely souls, come
Legion of the dawn
United in our misery
Together we will walk on

We wait for you to get in line
The legion of the dawn
Forgotten hearts, forgotten times
A unity's reborn
There's a light, there's a life so clear (so clear)
There's a place (there's a place), come here (come here)

All you, lonely souls, come
Legion of the damned
United in our pain
Together till the end
All you, lonely souls, come
Legion of the dawn
United in our misery
Together we will walk on

We'll let this torture end today
Long for shelter and relief
We'll let this torture end today
In high spirits we can leave
In high spirits we can leave

All you, lonely souls, come
Legion of the damned
United in our pain
Together till the end
All you, lonely souls, come
Legion of the dawn
United in our misery
Together we will walk on

All you, lonely souls, come
Legion of the damned
United in our pain
Together till the end
All you, lonely souls, come
Legion of the dawn
United in our misery
Together we will walk
Together we will walk
Together we will walk on
