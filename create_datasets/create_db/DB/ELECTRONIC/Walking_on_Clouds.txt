Chaste faded days 
With eyes that cannot see 
I want to feel it again washing over me 
Discover all of you 
One moment at a time 
Taste smell secret sell 
Your soul it touches mine

I want to feel alive
Hope knows I need it this way 
Like I'm walking on clouds 
I can't come down 
Even if you wanted me to 
I can't come down 
Even if you wanted me to

Nothing can stop me
I'm never satisfied
I take what I want 
Refuse to be denied 
Live in the moment 
The future can disguise 
It's starting to touch us 
But I still can't touch the sky

I need to feel alive 
Hope knows I need it this way 
Like I'm walking on clouds 
I can't come down 
Even if you wanted me to
I can't come down 
Even if you wanted me to
