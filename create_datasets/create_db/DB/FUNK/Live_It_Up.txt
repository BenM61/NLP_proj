You never want to comfort me
Knowing what you really need
You always say youve had enough
You never want to give it up

But everybodys got to move and
Everybodys got to groove
Everybody needs love sure enough
Everybody ought to live it up
Well what did I do that was wrong
I just want to have some fun
Weve been holding back for too 
And I want to live, weve gotta live it up
Ive got to ease your mind
I know Ill have a bit of luck
To make you have a good time
I've got to make you live it up
