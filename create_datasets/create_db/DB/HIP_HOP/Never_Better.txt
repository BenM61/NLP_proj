Beaten within an inch of my life, I was my own victim
Tried out therapy, kept getting hits in
All I saw was red light
Even my fucking therapist couldn't get my name right
Pathetic in my own way
Stuck in a rut of being miserable and stone-faced
Caught up in my own place
People saw it differently, this is my own take
This is no mixtape
This is no love song, this is no piss-take
Then I met her
I fixed up, flew right, got shit together

Never really better
Nothing gets better than you
I'mma go get her, I'm thinking forever, this is true
Never been better, lighter than a feather, now
My defenses dropped, I was lost, but I've been found

Instincts told me, keep being the old me
Keep being lonely, true love is phony
But this girl showed me
Progress, proceed, even if it throws me
Talk is always so cheap
Can't word how well this girl knows me
And I don't really smoke weed
But I'm so high right now, feel so blowy
Make our own fun, do our own thing
Doesn't matter, what the world brings
Anybody, wanna try us
Let 'em try it, fly by us

Never really better
Nothing gets better than you
I'mma go get her, I'm thinking forever, this is true
Never been better, lighter than a feather, now
My defenses dropped, I was lost, but I've been found

I've been found, found
found
Never been better
Never really found this
I've been found

Never really better
Nothing gets better than you
I'mma go get her, I'm thinking forever, this is true
Never been better, lighter than a feather, now
My defenses dropped, I was lost, but I've been found

I've been found (I've been found)
Found (found)
Found, found
Never been better
Never been, like this
