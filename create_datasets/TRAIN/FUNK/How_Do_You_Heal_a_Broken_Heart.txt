I can't believe what i just heard 
Could it be true 
Are you the girl I thought I knew 
The one who promised me her love 
Where did it go 
Does anybody ever know 

How do you heal a broken heart 
That feels like it will never beat this much again 
Oh no 
I just can't let go 
How do you heal a broken heart 
That feels like it will never love this much again 
Oh no 
Tonight I'll hold what could be right 
Tomorrow I'll pretend to let you go 

And were you ever what you seemed 
Or was I a fool who fell in love 
With his own dream 
And now you say you want to leave 
Start a new life today 
Those words I thought you'd never say 

How do you heal a broken heart 
That feels like it will never beat this much again 
Oh no 
I just can't let go 
How do you heal a broken heart 
That feels like it will never love this much again 
Oh no 

Tonight I'll hold what could be right 
Tomorrow I'll pretend to 
Find and put it all behind me 
Wake and find that I have finally found 
A new life 
In my soul 
And find that I know how to let you go 
You go 

How do you heal a broken heart 
That feels like it will never beat this much again 
Oh no 
I just can't let go 
How do you heal a broken heart 
That feels like it will never love this much again 
Oh no 

Tonight I'll hold what could be right 
Tomorrow I'll pretend to 
Wake and put it all behind me 
And find that I know how to let you go...
