Hail the hero coming home
Honor bound from whence he roamed
Fortitude and skill
Call of duty all alone

Lead the nation for the crown
Serve the orders coming down
Charge ahead with pride
Guard the chivalry you've shown

Those forsaken reawakened with my battle cry

Indestructible by choice
Valor rings out with the voice
Rail the consequence
Destiny's the flag you hoist

Your endeavor lives forever with my battle cry

Battle cry
Death defy
Battle cry
Never die

Cast this sorrow to the wind

Let tomorrow be the light you're made to herald in

Like a master of the seven seas
Your reputation's grown
This eternal flame's been sown

Praise for sacrifice that's done
Well deserved you carried on
Let your hearts be full
For those heroes every one

Restitution absolution with my battle cry
Exoneration condemnation with my battle cry

Battle cry
Death defy
Battle cry
Battle cry
