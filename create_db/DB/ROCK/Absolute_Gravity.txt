Her gravity make me feel light-headed
Small-talk turns to dust in my mouth
She doesn't know that I'm already
Thinking bout how I'm gonna make her look my way
But she smiles at herself in mirrors
A little too often these days
Maybe I'm unbalanced
The way she walks, my God she'd get it
All my friends reckon she is oh so fine
But the way I talk when I'm speaking near her
She must think I crawled out of the sea today
