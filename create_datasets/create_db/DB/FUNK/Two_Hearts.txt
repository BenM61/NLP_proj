All my life I've been told 
Men don't show much emotion 
And they say 
With love we play 
Games that have no devotion 

Now I'm the type to fall in love 
Every morning 
Stay right here 
Girl, don't you fear 
I'll never hurt you 

For your love 
There is nothing that I wouldn't do 
Here's my heart 
want to live my life with you 
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do 
Spend all my days and nights 
Always lovin' you, so baby 

Two hearts 
Can't stop 
Love's feelings 
That's deeper every moment we're living 
Can't stop this lovin' feeling 

Every time I look at you 
You remind me of heaven 
Stars at night are in your light 
I say that I'm crazy 

For your love 
There is nothing that I wouldn't do 
Here's my heart 
want to live my life with you 
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do 
Spend all my days and nights 
Always lovin' you, so baby 

When we're face to face 
Love is a blessing 
No one can control 
No matter what they say 
Love is a lesson 
I won't let you go 

Two hearts 
Can't stop 
Love's feelings 
That's deeper every moment we're living 
Can't stop this lovin' feeling 

Can't stop this lovin' feeling 
Lady, don't stop 
Do me the same way, baby 
Start from the top 
Lost in this lovin' feeling 
Can't hide this lovin' feeling 

Two hearts 
Can't stop 
Love's feelings 
That's deeper every moment we're living 
Can't stop this lovin' feeling
