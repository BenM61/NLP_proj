Gone with the wind
Just like a leaf that has flown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has blown away
Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips
I've had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips

But now all-all is gone
Gone is the rapture that fills my heart
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown apart

Just like a flame
Love burned brightly, then became
An empty smoke ring that has gone
Gone with the wind

Gone, gone, gone with the wind
Just like a leaf that has flown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown away
Yesterday's kisses are still, still on my lips
I've had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips

But now all-all is gone
Gone is the rapture that fills my heart
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown apart

Just like a flame
Love burned brightly, then became
An empty smoke ring that has
Gone with the wind

Gone with the wind
