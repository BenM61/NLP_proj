You are so special to me
Loving you was surely meant to be
And when I'm feeling blue
You hold me close
You've always been so special to me

When I think about my life
Before I met you
I'd wake up to this loneliness
And long for someone new

You have been the reason
For me to carry on
I can't imagine life at all
If your love was gone

You are so special to me
Loving you was surely meant to be
And when I'm feeling blue
You hold me close
You've always been so special to me

When we're together
There's nothing we can't do
There can be no other
I would compare to you

You have been the reason
For me to carry on 
I can't imagine life at all
If your love was gone

You are so special to me
Loving you was surely meant to be
And when I'm feeling blue
You hold me close
You've always been so special to me

There could never be
Another love for me
' Cause you made my dreams come true
Love until the end
We'll be lovers, best of friends
Stay with me 
Eternally
