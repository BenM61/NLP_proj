Hi de ho, baby, so long
She don't love me no more

Hi de hi, hi de ho
This is the way the song goes
Hi de hi, hi de ho
That's what she said to me

Hi de hi, hi de ho
This is the way my love goes
Hi de hi, hi de ho
She wasn't meant for me

One night while sitting all alone
I heard a ringing on the phone
So sweet and gentle as she could be
These are the words that she said to me

She said, Baby,(ooh ooh ooh)
I'm sorry
Darlin'(ooh ooh ooh)
I'm leavin'
Sugar(ooh ooh ooh)
I can't take it
Sweet heart (ooh ooh ooh)
it's all over", I say

Hi de hi, hi de ho
This is the way the song goes
Hi de hi, hi de ho
That's what she said to me

Hi de hi, hi de ho
Hmm, what a surprise
Hi de hi, hi de ho
It just about blew my mind

Now that I'm sitting all alone
Can't shake this feeling even though she's gone
They say that memories fade in time
The words she said to me still linger in my mind

She said Baby, (ooh ooh ooh)
I'm sorry
Darlin'(ooh ooh ooh)
I'm leaving
Sugar (ooh ooh ooh)
I can't take it
Sweet heart (ooh ooh ooh )
it's all over", I say

Hi de hi, hi de ho
This is the way the song goes
Hi de hi, hi de ho
That's what she said to me

Hi de hi, hi de ho
This is the way my love goes
Hi de hi, hi de ho
She wasn't meant for me

'Cause I've got my life to live, (I've got my life to live)
oh yeah
I got so much to give (so much to live)

Not gonna let this thing take me
I gotta keep on movin'
I gotta keep movin' and groovin'
So I can get back in the groove, groove, groove, groove, yeah
She don't love me no more (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Hi de hi, hi de ho
This is the way the song goes
Hi de hi, hi de ho
That's what she said to me

Hi de hi, hi de ho
This is the way my love goes
Hi de hi, hi de ho
She wasn't meant for me

She don't love me no more
Hi de hi, hi de ho
She's gone (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Hi de hi, hi de ho
She's out of my life

She don't love me no more
Hi de hi, hi de ho
She's gone (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Hi de hi, hi de ho
So long, baby

She don't love me more
Hi de hi, hi de ho
Why you wanna do that to me? (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Hi de hi, hi de ho
You hurt me so bad

She don't love me no more
Hi de hi, hi de ho
Why you wanna do that to me? (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
