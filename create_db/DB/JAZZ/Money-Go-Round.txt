It's no good praying to the powers that be
'cause they won't shake the roots of the money tree
No good praying to the pristine alters
Waiting for the blessing with holy water
They like the same old wealth in the same old hands
Means the same old people stay old people stay in command
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
They got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

Too much money in too few places
Only puts a smile on particular faces
Said too much power in not enough hands
Makes me think "get rich quick; take all I can"
They're too busy spending on the means of destruction
To ever spend a penny on some real construction

Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
They amuse themselves as they fool around
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like they say, make them vulnerable

No good looking to the empire corners,
"civilization" built on slaughter
Carrying hopes and carrying maps
The spineless ones fall in their laps
The brave and the bold are the ones to be fooled
With a diet of lies by the Kipling school

Watch your money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
But I just can't help being cynical
Watch your money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
Do like I say, make me wonderful

Their morals are clean and their clear
They bend your arm and they bend your ear
Said they bend your mind as you talk in circles
Bend over forwards, this won't hurt you
Till there's blood in your lap, blood on your hands
Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
Come spend a penny, go out with a pound
Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

(on the money-go-round, you wanna get on but it won't slow down)

The need your votes and you know where to send 'em
Be we don't get the choice of a public referendum
On all the real issues that affect our lives
Like the usa base to which we play midwife
Take a cruise and forget this scene
Said come back later when the slates wiped clean

Watch your money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
Born of woman, killed by man
Watch the money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
Do like they pray, make it wonderful

The good and righteous sing their hymns
The crimpoline dresses who have no sins
Christians by day, killers in war
The hypocrites who know what they're fighting for
Killing for peace, freedom and truth
But they're too old to go so they send the youth

Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
I don't think he was an astronaut
Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
I must insist, he was a socialist!

Watch your money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
They got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound
Watch your money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground
