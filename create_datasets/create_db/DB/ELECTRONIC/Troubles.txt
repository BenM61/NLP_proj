Dear Lord, can you take it away
This pain in my heart that follows me by day
And at night it stalks me like the shadows on my wall
Oh my goodness

Feels like the world is closing on me
Feels like my dreams will never come to me
I keep on slipping deeper into myself
And I'm scared, so scared

(If you're troubled) you've just gotta let it go
(If you're worried, baby) you've just gotta let it go
(All your hustles ain't for nothing)
You've just gotta take it slow
(When you need me, baby) all you do is let me know

Why does it feel that my mind is constantly trying to pull me down?
I can't seem to get a way
Continuous mistakes I know I've made before
How long will I feel so out of place?

(If you're troubled) you've just gotta let it go
(If you're worried, baby) you've just gotta let it go
(All your hustles ain't for nothing)
You've just gotta take it slow
(When you need me, baby) all you do is let me know

Yeah, I know it, can't stop
(If you're troubled) you've just gotta let it go
(If you're worried, baby) you've just gotta let it go
(All your hustles ain't for nothing)
You've just gotta take it slow
(When you need me, baby) all you do is let me know

(If you're troubled) you've just gotta let it go
(If you're worried, baby) you've just gotta let it go
(All your hustles ain't for nothing)
You've just gotta take it slow
(When you need me, baby) all you do is let me know

(If you're troubled) you've just gotta let it go
(If you're worried, baby) you've just gotta let it go
(All your hustles ain't for nothing)
You've just gotta take it slow
(When you need me, baby) all you do is let me know

(If you're troubled) you've just gotta let it go
(And if you're worried, baby) you've just gotta let it go
(All your hustles ain't for nothing)
You've just gotta take it slow
(When you need me, baby) all you do is let me know

Oh, but I will run to you
You, you don't have to worry, baby
