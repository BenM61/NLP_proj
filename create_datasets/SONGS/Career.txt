Career
He want and got a career
He sold all of his paints and
Bought a phone plan
He wanted someone
To show everyone
He wasn't slow though
Got it for low low
Ditched his friends
Went with the flow

Said hard work is its own reward
Bought a silk tie and an '09 Ford
Career

He put all his ambitions
Inside a basket
From the cradle
To the casket
Put away such childish things
Father Ray said, "Son
You'll go far if you know the score"
Bought a silk tie and an '09 Ford
Career

He went and got a career, C-C-C-C

Once used to be
The enemy of the bourgeoisie
Now he's actioning transactions ASAP
He went and got a career, C-C-C-C
