Looking back at me I see that
I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you,
I'm always wrapped up in things I cannot win
You are the antidote that gets me by,
Something strong like a drug that gets me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so

Cold to you, I'm sorry about all the lies,
Maybe in a different light,
You can see me stand on my own again
Cause now I can see
You are the antidote that got me by,
Something strong like a drug that got me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold

I never meant to be, so cold

I never really wanted you to see
The screwed-up side of me
That I keep locked inside of me so deep,
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me there's just no hope;
I never meant to be so cold

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am  (Is I'm sorry for the way)
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold
