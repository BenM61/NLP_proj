Way back when I saw magic
You can blame it all
On your friends and your companions
I knew you way back when
I knew you too, yeah

No disappointing
You are my favorite
I knew you had it in

You do be a success in life
A sensation
You can blame it all
On big city stimulation

But I knew you when
The small town attraction
Baby, you can't pretend
You don't need the reaction
Sophisticated friends
Now fill your moment
(Way back when)

Way back when I, I saw magic
You can blame it all
On your friends and your companions
But I knew you when
I knew you too, yeah

No disappointing end
You are my favorite, yes, you are
(Way back when)
I knew you too, yeah, baby
(Way back when)
'Cause you are my friend
(Way back when)
I know you too, yeah

I knew when
I know you too, yes, I do, baby
Oh, oh, oh
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it
Oh yeah, oh

(Way back when)
(Way back when)
I know you too, yeah
(Way back when)
Baby
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it

(Way back when)
(Way back when)
Way back when
