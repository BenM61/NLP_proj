I've got education
I've got wealth and power
I've got a good salary
How wonderful life can be

I respect APG
I've got a elephant brand prize
Health is a great element of happiness
That's all for today
Sing with loud voice

March
So long
You need
Outside
Science friction

O.E.A.U!
Wall now

When I came back, my suitcase was gone
I meant it to be a practical joke

Beginners English isn't all that easy
We must work to live!
