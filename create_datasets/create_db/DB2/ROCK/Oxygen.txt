Stop playing Jesus, Judas disguised, I know you fake it all the time.
One love to my love, One compromise, I know your blood tastes like wine.

And if I breathe in for you, can your heart shine through?
The only pain is to feel none at all.
And if we stay here tonight, under the moonlit sky, 
Will we breathe in, or will our hearts just fade away?
Well you take away my oxygen.

Tonight we're loveless, help cries above.
We try to forget our love.
I let you down now, poisoned your lips, will this be our last kiss?

And if I breathe in for you, can your heart shine through?
The only pain is to feel none at all.
And if we stay here tonight, under the moonlit sky, 
Will we breathe in, or will our hearts just fade away?
Well you take away my oxygen.

And if I breathe in for you, can your heart shine through?
The only pain is to feel none at all.
And if we stay here tonight, under the moonlit sky, 
Will we breathe in, or will our hearts just fade away?
Well you take away, you take away, you take away my oxygen.
