If you can't see that I'm here
Did the moment pass you by?
Are the words there out to try?

'Cause you were what I thought you thought I knew
You moved, I followed you so fast
Made me run and then I learned that taking time will make us last

Tell me if you love someone
She tells you how to live your life
But you're looking for something more
Don't wanna be nobody else
And you let them know that
It's not you
You're not afraid
Lines around your eyes will disappear

If you don't know where to go
If you won't leave 'til it's done
Tell me if there can't be won
I don't know where we should run
Watch and hear the noise it makes you smile
But it will leave you burned
We're all rushing in around
Let's make it work and see what we have learned
 
Tell me if you love someone
She taught you how to live your life
But you're looking for something more
Don't wanna be nobody else
And you let them know that
It's not you
You're not afraid
Lines around your eyes will disappear

All of this falls down
All of this falls down
Words that will fall out
Faster than you're running oh
And I heard that
Did you let them go to waste?
The words they will fall out
Faster than you're running oh
And I heard that
Did you let them?

Tell me if you love someone
Do you love them all?

She taught you how to live your life
But you're looking for something more
Don't wanna be nobody else
And you let them know that
It's not you
You're not afraid
Lines around your eyes will disappear
