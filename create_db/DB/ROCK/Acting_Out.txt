Up above the surface I was just a perfect child
But underneath it all I was craving to be wild
Don't you judge by the cover it's so far from what you see
I'm losing all my patience waiting on ya to believe

I'm suffocating, I can't breathe
Let me out this cage, I'm not gonna hold back
Gonna break these chains, I'm taking control now
Gonna give ya something to talk about
It's another side of me
I'm acting out

Set me free, I'm ready to show you
This is what I need, it's time to get dirty
I'm a show you what I'm talking about
It's another side of me
I'm acting out

Welcome to a new beginning, it's time to start the show
No I don't think it matters if it's real or just a role
Once you get a taste of it you'll be begging me for more
I'll give ya something to remember once I hit the floor
I'm letting go of what you know

Let me out this cage, I'm not gonna hold back
Gonna break these chains, I'm taking control now
Gonna give ya something to talk about
It's another side of me
I'm acting out

Set me free, I'm ready to show you
This is what I need, it's time to get dirty
I'm a show you what I'm talking about
It's another side of me
I'm acting out

I've been waiting just to drive you crazy
Now it's my time and yes it feels amazing
There's nothing left of what you've seen before
Life's too short just to do what you're told

Just to do what you're told, just to do what you're told
Do what you're told
Just to do what you're told
Do what, do what you're told

Let me out this cage, I'm not gonna hold back
Gonna break these chains, I'm taking control now
Gonna give ya something to talk about
It's another side of me
I'm acting out

Set me free, I'm ready to show you
This is what I need, it's time to get dirty
I'm a show you what I'm talking about
It's another side of me
I'm acting out

Life's too short just to do what you're told, I'm acting out
Life's too short just to do what you're told, I'm acting out
Life's too short just to do what you're told, I'm acting out
Yeah yeah, I'm acting out
