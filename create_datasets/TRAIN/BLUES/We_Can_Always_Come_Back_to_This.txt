Standing at the station, we don't know what to say
Looking out the window as you're rolling away
If I'm gonna be alone, let it be with you

Mother don't you cry, we're gonna be all right
Open up your suitcase when you get there tonight
You're not alone, I'm always with you

No matter where we go from here
No matter how the cards will fall
I'll pick you up, and you'll hold me too
So don't give up on me, I'll never give up on you
Everything's gonna be alright, I know you believe it too
If I'm gonna be alone, let it be with you
If I'm gonna be alone, let it be with you

Look up, not down
It all comes around
Even when we're gone
We can always come back to this
We can always come back to this
We can always come back to this
We can always come back to this
Back to this
We can always come back to this
Back to this
We can always come back to this
We can always come back to this
We can always come back to this
We can always come back to this

If I'm gonna be alone, let it be with you
