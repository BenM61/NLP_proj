Let it shine on me, let it shine on me
Oh, let Your light from the lighthouse shine on
Let it shine on me, let it shine on me
Oh, let Your light from the lighthouse shine on

My Lord, he's done just what he said
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Heal the sick and rise the dead
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me

Oh, let it shine on well, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on oh, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me

I know I've got religion and I ain't ashamed
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Angels in Heaven, done wrote my name
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me

Oh, let it shine on well, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on well, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me

Oh, let it shine on oh, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on well, let shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me

Shine on oh, let it shine on
Let Your light from the lighthouse shine on me
Shine on oh, let it shine on
Let Your light shine on me
