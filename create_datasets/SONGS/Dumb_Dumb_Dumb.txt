It's been playing on my mind
I don't want to waste your time
And the thought of you is
Tearing me apart

Had a name but now that's gone
I don't know where I went wrong
Now I'm all alone and drifting in the dark

Take me back to what I know
Cause I don't know where to go
And I'm finding it so hard to stay in tune

But it's hard to comprehend
Getting closer to the end
And I hope that I'll be feeling better soon

Now I'm just a fading light
But I want to feel alright
And I hope that you can
Help me through the days

And I find it hard to sleep
Cause I sold myself so cheap
Do you think about me when I go away?
