Here we are
We've come so far
A fine romance
Of steppin' out to dance.

Your lovely charms
When you're in my arms
That subtle glance
When steppin' out to dance.
To dance, to dance

Could you think it over?
When we get older
I'll still want you here with me
Darling I hope that you agree
There's something that takes place
Whenever we embrace
I'm hoping that you take this chance
Of steppin' out to dance.
Out to dance, out to dance.

Here we are
We've come so far.

Could you think it over?
When we get older
I'll still want you here with me
Darling I hope that you agree
There's something that takes place
Whenever we embrace
I'm hoping that you take this chance
Of steppin' out.

Could you think it over?
When we get older
I'll still want you here with me
Darling I hope that you agree
There's something that takes place
Whenever we embrace
I'm hoping that you take this chance
Of steppin' out to dance.
