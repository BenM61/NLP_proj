I know it's not you're problem but it's true
I never have the time of day for you

You don't have fever
Don't have fever
You don't have fever
You've got you

You walk the streets alone
You're striking out for home
I don't want other loved ones
I want you
I don't want other loved ones
I want you

You don't have fever
You don't have fever
You don't have fever
You've got you

You walk the streets at night
You've been lookin for a fight
Sometimes what your afters not your fault
'Cause happy ever afters what your taught

You don't have fever
You don't have fever
You don't have fever
You've got you

No one makes you calm
Though you've got people on your arm
