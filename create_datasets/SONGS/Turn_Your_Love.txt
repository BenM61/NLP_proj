Turn your love way up inside
I know you like to hide away
Keep your head down, sleep the day away
You're left in such a state
Keeps me so inclined, just you turn your love way up inside

Now we got back, darling, don't you wanna know?
A little too soon, still a little bit soft
If I could make that bond, we could get to the bottom
It's just you turn your love way up inside

Yeah, there's always something
Oh, to making it true
I used to, baby
I don't feel the strongest singing my own songs and I used to, baby

Now that I forgot all those things I've been forgetting
Now that I said all those things I needed saying
I will come back, I won't mind
It's just you turn your love way up inside
To making it true
Making it true
Like I used to, baby

There was always something
Oh, to making it true
I used to, baby
But I don't feel the strongest singing my own songs
