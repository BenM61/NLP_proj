Oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, ooh, yeah

I'm searchin' my soul tonight
It's breakin' my heart
I'm wearin' this mask tonight
But I'm falling apart

Am I somewhere in the corners of your mind?
Do you see me when you close your eyes at night?
I will love you 'till the sun no longer shines
Am I far away or am I on your mind?

Am I on your mind?
Oh, ooh yeah
Am I on your mind?
Oh, ooh, yeah
I'm searchin' my soul tonight
I'm down on my knees
I'm tryin' to get myself together
I'm tryin' to breathe
I'm tryin' to breathe
Oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, ooh, yeah

Am I somewhere in the corners of your mind?
Do you see me when you close your eyes at night?
I will love you till the sun no longer shines
Am I far away or am I on your mind?

Am I on your mind?
Am I on your mind?
I'm searchin' my soul tonight
I'm searchin' my soul tonight

Am I somewhere in the corners of your mind?
Do you see me when you close your eyes at night?
I will love you till the sun no longer shines
Am I far away or am I on your mind?

Am I on your mind?
Oh, ooh, yeah
Am I on your mind?
Oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, ooh, yeah
Am I on your mind?
Oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, ooh, yeah
