Girl you hit me with the bomb
Then you said so long
You don't wanna play no more
Girl you hit me with the bomb
Then you said so long
You don't wanna play no more

You wanna step to this
Come on and step right up
You wanna test my faith
'Cause you ain't good enough
You took my kindness for weakness
My weakness for your sweetness
It's all about the things you do

The gal step to mi face and dis the groove
Boon boon she just dis the move
She gimme loving so she de pon mi mind
Up town, down town, still can't find
Like wee willy winkle I'm running through the town
Upstairs, downstairs, round and round
Knocking on ya window
Baby come back
So take it from the top
And gimme lovin non stop

Girl you hit me with the bomb
Then you said so long
You don't wanna play no more
Girl you hit me with the bomb
Then you said so long
You don't wanna play no more

Tat tat tat da dat
Tat tat tat da dat
Tat tat tat da dat dat da da

You like to play around
Messing with my mind
I fight to keep my sanity
The word is out on the street
And everyone you meet
They tell of all the things you do

Ya'll get stop the less or not
What are ya nai not tippin that
She was a girl with a heart of stone
Took me on the line that she leave me alone
Like wee willy winkle I'm running through the town
Upstairs, downstairs, round and round
Knocking on ya window
Baby come back
Take it from the top
And gimme lovin non stop

Girl you hit me with the bomb
Then you said so long
You don't wanna play no more
Girl you hit me with the bomb
Then you said so long
You don't wanna play no more

Girl you hit me with the bomb
Then you said so long
You don't wanna play no more
Girl you hit me with the bomb
Then you said so long
You don't wanna play no more
