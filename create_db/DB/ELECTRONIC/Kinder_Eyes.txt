I'm not over all the messed up shit you said
I forgive you, but it's not easy to forget
Eventually I'll find a place to lock these hard feelings away
Eventually, but not right now

I was gonna let it slide
'Til you went and fooled me twice
Man, I really hope in time
I view you like I used to
I was gonna let it slide
'Til you went and fooled me twice
Man, I really hope in time
I view you like I used to

One day, I'll look at you through
Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
One day I'll look at you through
Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
But not right now

When we're older I'll let you chalk it up to youth
When I'm colder and you don't trigger my short fuse
Eventually I'll find a place in my heart to give you grace
Eventually, but not right now

One day I'll look at you through
Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
One day I'll look at you through
Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
But not right now
One day I'll look at you through
Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
But not right now

I was gonna let it slide
'Til you went and fooled me twice
Man, I really hope in time
I view you like I used to
I was gonna let it slide
'Til you went and fooled me twice
Man, I really hope in time
I view you like I used to

One day I'll look at you through
Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
But not right now
