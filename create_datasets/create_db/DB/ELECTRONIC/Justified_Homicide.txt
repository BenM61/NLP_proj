Now I wouldn't want to advocate 
Violence or bloodshed against the state 
But if some fiendish criminal mind 
Were to contemplate action of a similar kind 

It's a justified homicide 
Your exploding brain'd make a beautiful sound 
Justified homicide 
Your shredded limbs should decorate the ground 

Company man, you got nothing to give 
You've been selling out since you were a kid 
You got your nose caught in the trough 
Excuse me if I cut it off 

String 'em up for treason 
String 'em up for good 
String 'em up for treason 
String 'em up for good
