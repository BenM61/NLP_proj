Now it's official
I've sent my body on a mission
I left my brain where it's belonging
Cause I won't need it where I'm going

The heads are turning
We so beautiful it's hurting
Bring on bananas and the bubbly
Because we are ready to get ugly

Everybody lose it we are going to smash this room
Everybody lose it but not until the boing clash boom

Everybody lose it we are going to smash this room
Everybody lose it but not until the boing clash boom

Boing clash boom

Cheating is winning
We keep on winning til the morning
And keep on smiling when we're ballin
While the boing clash keep on calling

Everybody lose it
Everybody lose it
Everybody lose it we are going to smash this room
Everybody lost it but not until the boing clash boom
