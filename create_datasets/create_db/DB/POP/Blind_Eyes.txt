Oh, ooh, ooh oh ooh, oh oh
Oh, aah, ah ah aah, aah

Old lady in the street ain't here no more
Got robbed last week at her own front door
No one saw her fall and no one heard her cry
Everyone there just turned a blind eye

Don't look left, now don't look right
Take another step back, don't see no sight
Keep a straight face, lead a streetwise life
If you were there, could you turn a blind eye?

Blind eyes are weak, blind eyes are cruel
Look out for number one, survival's the rule
Look straight ahead on a one-way street
Let sleeping dogs lie, just turn a blind eye
(Don't look left, don't look right)
(Let sleeping dogs lie, just turn a blind eye)

Maybe one day it'll happen to you
You know lightning strikes without warning
Who'll see you struggle and who'll hear you cry
When everybody there just turn a blind eye?

Blind eyes are weak, blind eyes are cruel
Look out for number one, survival's the rule
Look straight ahead on a one-way street
Let sleeping dogs lie, just turn a blind eye

Blind eyes are weak, blind eyes are cruel
Look out for number one, survival's the rule
Look straight ahead on a one-way street
Let sleeping dogs lie, just turn a blind eye

Blind eyes are weak
Blind eyes are cruel
Let sleeping dogs lie
Just turn a blind eye

Blind eyes are weak
Blind eyes are cruel
Let sleeping dogs lie
Just turn a blind eye

Don't turn a blind eye
Don't turn a blind eye
Don't turn a blind eye
Eye

Oh, ooh, ooh oh ooh, oh oh
Oh, aah, ah ah aah, aah
