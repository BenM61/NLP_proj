Go ahead don't go 
Don't leave my open arms all warm 
And go see I don't know if your here for me 
Well look the afternoon is the only place where you and I belong 
Your mine forever and a day 

Your beautiful your beautiful to me
Your beautiful your beautiful to me

Definitely this cannot be all that you 
Have to offer love 
When your on your own 
Well look I fell in love 
'Cause this world is way to big now

Your beautiful your beautiful to me
Your beautiful your beautiful to me

And its a love love love that is here with me

Well look the afternoon is the only place where you and I belong 
Your mine forever and a day 

Your beautiful your beautiful to me
Your beautiful your beautiful to me
Your beautiful your beautiful to me
Your beautiful your beautiful to me
