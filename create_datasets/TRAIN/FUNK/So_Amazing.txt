Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
Or minute I had since you come my way
I hope you know I gladly go
Anywhere you take me

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

I got, got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come and it has changed my whole world
Bye bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above, above

And it's so amazing, so amazing
I could stay forever, forever
Here in love and would leave you never
'Cause we go amazing love
Truly it's amazing, so amazing
Love brought us together, together
I would leave you never and never
'Cause we got amazing love

Ooh, so amazing and I've been waiting
For a love like you

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

And it's love, it's so
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

And you and I, it's so
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

It's so
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
