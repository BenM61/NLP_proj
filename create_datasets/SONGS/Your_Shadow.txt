Shadow
Illuminate your soul

Illuminate your soul
Expose the shade
Liquefy your heart
Drown the pain

Fairy light of love
Fades away
The trifle above
Your shadow

I can never see your
Shadow at night
I can never feel your
Shadow real tight
Only see your shadow
Down down drown

Illuminate your soul
Expose the shade
Liquefy your heart
Drown the pain

Color your eyes
Blue indigo for the lies
Cover your life with
The shadow of your eyes

Illuminate your face
Expose the shade

Your shadow

I can never see your
Shadow at night
I can never feel your
Shadow real tight
Only see your shadow
Down down drown

I would fade away
Like a red flower
I would fade away
Like a red flower
I would fade away
Like a red flower
I would fade away
Like a red flower's

Shadow at night
I can never feel your
Shadow real tight
Only see your shadow
Down down

Shadow at night
I can never feel your
Shadow real tight
Only see your shadow
Down down drown

Like a red flower
Like a red flower
Like a red flower
Like a red flower
