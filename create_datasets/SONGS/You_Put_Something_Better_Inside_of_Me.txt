You put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.

I could look out the window or stare at the wall,
But really it didn't matter, no, I just didn't care at all.
Could be sitting by the water, counting every stone,
Cause nothing means nothing when you're empty and on your own.

But you put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.
Makes me so much stronger,
I'm amazed at the change in me.

Well, I knew what I was doing, I was running away,
Busy going nowhere, just wasting the time of day.
Walking down the road, kicking up the stones,
Nothing means nothing when you're empty and on your own.

But you put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.
Makes me so much stronger,
I'm amazed at the change in me.
