What you got on tap, I'll take two of that 
I'm chasing a story I heard
When I was here last, at the back of the class
You pretended you never got lost
You're at the back of the class, in the back of the bus
Sitting out at the dance, so we're saying "no, thanks"
When they see you around, you look down at the ground 
But when they walk away you'd wish they'd stay

Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart

You can't help but stare at everyone there
It's you versus everyone else
Your outfit's a crime, you feel their cold minds
Placing you under arrest
And you serve your time drinking all night long
Staring at the walls of your jail-like home
Listening to that song, cause it hurts just right
Till everything is gone tonight

Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart 
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart 
Never never mind your bleeding heart

Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart 
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart 
Never never mind your bleeding heart

Someday you'll grow up and then you'll forget
All of the pain you endured
Until you walk by, a sad pair of eyes
And up will come back all the hurt
And you'll see their pain as they look away 
And you want to help, but there's just no way 
Cause you won the war so it's not your turn 
But everything inside still burns 

Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart 
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart 
Never never mind your bleeding heart

Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart 
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind bleeding heart, bleeding heart 
Never never mind your bleeding heart

Never never never mind mind mind
Never mind your bleeding heart
Never never never mind mind mind
Never mind your bleeding heart

Never never never mind mind mind
Never mind your bleeding heart
Never never never mind mind mind

How long must I wait till you learn that it's not too late 
How long must I cry till you know that you really tried 
How long must I try till you learn that dreaming's hard 
How long must I dream till you heal your bleeding heart 
Never mind your bleeding heartï»¿
