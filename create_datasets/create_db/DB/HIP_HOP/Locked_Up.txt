I'm steady tryna find a motive, 
Why do what I do?, 
Freedom ain't gettin no closer, 
No matter how far I go, 
My car is stolen, no registration, 
Cops patrolin, and now they done stop me, 
And I get locked up, 

They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out, (im locked up) 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 
 
Headin up town to ria, 
Back with a couple peeps, 
Caught a blocks on fire, 
Under covers dressed as fiends, 
Makin so much money, 
Ride up smooth and fast, 
Put away the stash, 
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up 

They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (my nigga I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out, (i got locked up) 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (baby girl I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

'Cause visitation no longer comes by, 
Seems like they forgot about me, 
Commissary is getting empty, 
My cell mates getting food without me, 
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life, 
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right 
But instead I'm here locked up

They won't let me out, they won't let me out, 
(Ohhh I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out, 
(My nigga I'm locked up) 
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up) 
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 

Maybe a visit (they won't let me out)
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out)
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no)
Maybe a visit baby (they won't let me out)
'Cause I'm locked up, they won't let me out.
Where's my lawyer? (They won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no.
Get me outta here (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, they won't let me out.
Baby I'm locked up they won't let me out, no
Where's my niggaz?

'Cause I'm locked up, locked up, locked up.
