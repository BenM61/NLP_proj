Words one said with tenderness
Have become meaningless
Broken promises take their toll
Now you're playing the fool

Torn, between torment and bliss
Beckoned by temptation's kiss
Leave you're ambitions standing still
All you're dreams left unfulfilled
make up mind while there's still time to turn around

Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind

Lies that leave you cold inside
With a pain to hard to hide
Broken promises take their toll
Now you're playing the fool

Hide your face to save your shame
No one but yourself to blame
Leave you're ambitions standing still
All you're dreams left unfulfilled
Make up mind while there's still time to turn around
	
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind

Fooled by a smile

Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
