Barefoot in the sand
Wishing God would lend a hand
Wave after wave comes crashing down
Washing away a little more ground

Seems to me that's how all things are
Giving and taking little pink stars

I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to touch you
I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to feel you from the inside
I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to touch you
I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to touch you

Walking along with the ocean at my heels
Loving the way the water feels
Up in the sky something catches my eye
As bright as a star in the northern sky

Seems to me that's how all things are
Giving and taking little pink stars

I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to touch you
I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to feel you from the inside
I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to touch you
I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to touch you

Seems to me that's how all things are
Giving and taking little pink stars
Oh oh oh

I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to touch you
I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to feel you from the inside
I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to touch you
I want the world to know that you're mine
I want to touch you.
