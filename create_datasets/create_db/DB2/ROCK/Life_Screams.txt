Grand speeches pour out with the rain
On streets where no one's listening
And you curse the cold wind on your face
But she's trying to tell you something
A song unfolds in the distance
Somehow you feel it in your soul
But you carry on with your business
Like you didn't hear this melody 
That calls you home

Life sings out, calling you by name
Life screams out that all of this will change
Your lungs are only flesh
And everything that dies will fade away
Life calls for her lover
You will live forever

The sky is asking you to dance
With every drop a whisper
And you wipe her kiss off of your face
And throw away forever

Life sings out, calling you by name
Life screams out that all of this will change
Your hearts are only flesh
And everything that dies will fade away
Life calls for her lover
You will live forever

A song unfolds in the distance
Somehow you feel it in your soul
But you carry on with your business 
Like you didn't hear this melody
That calls you home

Life calls for her lover
You will live forever
Live forever
