Things are gonna change
And not for better
Don't know what it means to me
But it's hopeless, hopeless

Got to get you home
Could be with anyone
Think of what I've done, uh
You know it all

Everything is everything

Everything is everything
The more I talk about it
The less I do control
Everything means everything
Can't understand a word
Half of the stuff I'm sayin'

The things I do possess
Sometimes they own me too
What they gonna do to me?
It's hopeless, hopeless

What I can't explain
I'm sure you'll get it well
Since I always wanted
I always wanted you

Everything is everything
The more I talk about it
The less I do control
Everything means everything
Can't understand a word
Half of the stuff I'm sayin'

Riding low, riding low, riding faster
If this is what I want
Look at what it did to me
Riding low, riding low, riding faster
If this is what you want
This is what you get instead

Everything is everything
The more I talk about it
The less I do control
Everything means everything
Can't understand a word
Half of the stuff I'm sayin'

Riding low, riding low, riding faster
The more I talk about it
The less I do control
Riding low, riding low, riding faster
Can't understand a word
Half of the stuff I'm sayin'
