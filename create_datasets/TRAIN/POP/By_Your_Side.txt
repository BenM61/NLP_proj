I'll always be by your side
Even when you're down and out
I'll always be by your side
Even when you're down and out
I just wanted to be your housewife
All I wanted was to be your housewife

I'll iron your clothes
I'll shine your shoes
I'll make your bed
And cook your food
I'll never cheat

I'll be the best girl you'll ever meet
And for a diamond ring
I'll do these kinds of things
I'll scrub your floor
Never be a bore
I'll tuck you in
I do not snore
I'd wear your black eyes
Bake you apple pies
I don't ask why

And I try's not to cry's
I'll always be by your side
Even when you're down and out
I'll always be by your side
Even when you're down and out
And its nearly midnight
And all I want with my life

Is to be a housewife
Is to be a housewife
'Cause it's nearly midnight
And all I want with my life
Is to die a housewife
Is to die a housewife
