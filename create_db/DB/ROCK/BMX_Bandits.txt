Over and under we ride
In love with the suicide 
Here we f*ck with disaster and 
Careful is something to hide
So come give this trick a try 
Push it faster you bastard and 
Over this mountain you glide 
No you're not gonna last If you can't push it past

Nicole 
What's that you got is that a black Turbo Diamond Back? 
A JMC Racing Bike? 
Man I wish I had one like that. 

Nicole 
You stole my soul with your cute little bunny hop, your radical table top 
Girl I wished you would never stop. 

Nicole 
I was only ten years old 

Please leave your cell phone at home 
It's just a broken collar bone 
Walk it off you big pussy 
And get your ass back on the bike 
It's time to go lay some pipe 
Or just watch me get nice 
I'ma school you on how to get high 
Then go home tell your friends how you bite all my style

Is there a love in your life
Cause I wanna be your wife
It's a bird it's a plane
It's a bicycle up in the sky
You didn't say you could fly
Now I know where I stand and I'm
Tired of life on the ground
Loose my soul when I'm down up your ramp I am Found
