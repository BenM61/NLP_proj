I'm looking in from the outside
I wish my mind could read the score
Some day a door will open
Then I'll know then I'll see
What I'm striving for

If I could get an answer
If someone would give me a clue
I know I'd feel much better
But I can't find anyone
To put my question to

And when I'm older and wiser
And I look back on my youth
Will I be contented or will I see
Nothing but a vain search for the truth

And when I'm old and wiser
And I look back on my youth

I wish I knew better baby
My mind wouldn't be so sore
Some day a door will open
Then I'll know then I'll see
What I'm striving for

I'm looking in from the outside
I wish my mind could read the score
Some day a door will open 'faint' search. No,
Then I'll know then I'll see
What I'm striving for

If I could get an answer
If someone would give me a clue
I know I'd feel much better
But I can't find anyone
