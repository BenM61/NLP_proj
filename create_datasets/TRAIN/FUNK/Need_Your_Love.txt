I feel so blue
Without you girl
I need your love
That's why I'm down
'Cause you're not around now
I need your love
I want you to stay
Don't go away now
I need your love
Late at night
When shit ain't right girl
I need your love

Though I try
I can't deny
You know I
I need your love, baby
I need your love

Can't get enough
Of your good stuff now
I need your love
Don't be late
Girl, I can't wait now
I need your love
I played a fool
Just be cool now
I need your love
Without getting high
Girl, I can fly now
I need your love

Though I try
I can't deny
You know I
I need your love, baby
I need your love, sugar

There comes a time in every man's life
When he's got to have his woman's love
Y'all gonna hear me
Bring that bass back in
Alright

When I'm about to break
All I can take now
I need your love
You make me feel
Oh so real girl
I need your love
After this song
Girl come on now
I need your love
I play it again
Until the end now
I need your love

Though I try
I can't deny
You know I
I need your love, baby
I need your love, sugar
I need your love, baby
I need your love
