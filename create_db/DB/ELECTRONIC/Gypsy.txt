God is my witness 
I can feel you 
There before my very eyes 
A vision to me 

Don't put out this fire 
It's burning for... 
Burning for me 
Burning for you 

Stand within the sunlight 
Press against me 
Takes me back to other times 
Different days 

Love I do surrender 
Belongs to... 
Belongs to me 
Belongs to you 

Lay down on me 
Naked gypsy 
Watching you bathe in water 
False childhood lies 
Fear in your eyes 
Give me a son and daughter 

There is nothing I can see in my mind 
A picture of you painted so vividly 
Blood runs through my fingers 
And through... 
Through my light 
Through my darkness 

Lay down on me 
Naked gypsy 
Watching you bathe in water 
False childhood lies 
Fear in your eyes 
Give me a son and daughter 

Son and daughter 

Lay down on me 
Naked gypsy 
Watching you bathe in water 
False childhood lies 
Fear in your eyes 
Give me a son and daughter 

Lay down on me 
Naked gypsy 
Watching you bathe in water 
False childhood lies 
Fear in your eyes 
Give me a son and daughter 

Son and daughter
