Can I, should I, find my way home?
Or did I, think I, better go home?
All I, said I, needed was God
But I, thought I, had it all wrong

Now can it, ever, be the same way?
When they never seem to forgive
So it hurt more that you said
On the dark side of your head
Oh, she is following me in my head, but I am all alone
Thinking I'll fall every time I wanna try to let her go
It's never easy when you think you're in control
Somehow you get caught up in the moment and you never know
All these tiny cities that you're holding in your little hand
In the wind like diamond lights, they'll blow away in desert sand
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last

It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last

Why can't I fall down into the hole (Gotta get it, back back)
Why can't I fall down into the hole (Gotta get it, back back)

Can I ever get ahead of what I want and what I need?
And what do I have to do to get away from what is killing me?
How can I convince myself to not believe in what I know?
When all I see is dominoes falling up it as we go
