Vita mia
Quanta vita see'e
Dentro questi occhi in me

There've been times in my life
When I couldn't see a difference
In pain, or in joy, or in sun, or in rain
It just seemed the same

But I'm only human
Branded by ambition
But I'm going to make it count

Vita mia 
Quanta vita see'e
Ce nell'rosso acceso in me

Vita sia
Come un nuovo canto
Ora che, muoio per te

So many intentions
In life I could have followed
Here and now is how
I'll live every moment
Unafraid of what life gives
Respect things I don't understand

Vita sia
La tua vita in me
