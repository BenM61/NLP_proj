You told me this, 
You told me that
You try to tell me, 
Tell me where it's at
You said you loved me, 
I can see through that
Lies, lies, lies
You left me hangin', 
Hangin' from a limb
You said you loved me, 
Then you left with him
Lord, you did it to me, 
I see it in your eyes
Lies, lies, lies
Tell me baby, 
Why you take my time
You get a thrill off 
Playing with my mind
Lord, you did it to me, 
I see it in your eyes
Lies, lies, lies
