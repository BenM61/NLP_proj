Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by
Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by
Time keeps moving on and it never rewinds
Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by

Tell me what you want tell me what you see
Where you wanna go what you wanna be if you have a dream
You can make it there with a lot of work and a lot of prayer
If you take you time gotta be precise gotta have a plan
Double check it twice wait hold up slow down still gon' need advice
Someones gone before maybe talk to them then
After you do go and talk to him great is gonna come
Maybe not tonight take your time today futures looking bright

Got a lot of friends, led a lot of ends
Twitter you to trend in my Bentley Benz
But but you moving kind of fast
Keith Sweat you gotta make it last
Live every day like it's your last 
But don't forget to have blast

Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by
Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by
Time keeps moving on and it never rewinds
Don't miss this moment don't let it pass you by
