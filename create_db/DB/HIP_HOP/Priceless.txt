Yeah
This feels like one of those songs you know
This my dedication
To that shorty from the ghetto
So priceless
You mean the world
Hm listen

Damn, what a lucky man I am
I found someone who understands
And she don't care what she gotta do to please her man
Damn, she makes me want to raise my hands
Shout it out, spread the word
Telling everyone I can
Cause she's my only girl and I'm her only man

Damn, you're priceless like a rare jewel (yeah)
You're perfect like a dream come true (yeah)
Girl why can't the world be a little bit more like you (yeah)
And who says you can't find love
Proper love in the ghetto
Well I found it and she works it
Baby priceless, so priceless

Damn, shopping at the mall 10 grand
Another 20 on her finger and
I don't give a damn
Cause a love like hers is priceless (yeah)
And I know it ain't never been a money thing
Cause she'll love me even if I didn't have a thing
That's the kind of girl you are
And oh yeah

(And she'll be)
My one concern 
(And I'll be)
The one for her
(Forever)
I gotta learn
(Cause I know just what a girl like that is worth)
Ain't no price

Damn, you're priceless like a rare jewel (yeah)
You're perfect like a dream come true (yeah)
Girl why can't the world be a little bit more like you (yeah)
And who says you can't find love
Proper love in the ghetto
Well I found it and she works it
Baby priceless, so priceless

I never had anyone that I
I wanted to share everything with (no)
Till the day you came around
I knew you was the one for me
So if it's karats on your hands
A place to lay your head, all it takes to make you smile
And I'm willing to pay whatever the cost
Cause girl you're worth the price

Damn, you're priceless like a rare jewel (yeah)
You're perfect like a dream come true (yeah)
Girl why can't the world be a little bit more like you (yeah)
And who says you can't find love
Proper love in the ghetto
Well I found it and she works it
Baby priceless, so priceless

So priceless, so priceless, you're so priceless
So priceless, you're priceless like a rare jewel
So priceless, so priceless, you're so priceless
So priceless, you're priceless like a rare jewel
So priceless, so priceless, you're so priceless
So priceless, you're priceless like a rare jewel
So priceless, so priceless, you're so priceless
So priceless, you're priceless like a rare jewel
