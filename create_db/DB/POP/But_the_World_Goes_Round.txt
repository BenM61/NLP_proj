Sometimes you're happy
And sometimes you're sad
But the world goes round
And sometimes you lose
Every nickel you had
But the world goes round
Sometimes you're dreams get broken in pieces
But that doesn't matter at all
Take it from me, there's still going to be
A summer, a winter, a spring and a fall
And sometimes a friend starts treating you bad
But the world goes round
And sometimes your heart breaks
With a deafing sound
Somebody loses, and somebody wins
And one day it's kicks
And it's kicks in the shins
But the plant spins
And world goes round and round
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes your sad
But the world goes round
And sometimes you lose
Every nickel you had
But the world goes round
Sometimes your dreams get broken in pieces
But that shouldn't altar a thing
Take it from me, there's till going to be
A summer, a winter, a fall and a spring
And sometimes a friend starts treating you bad
But the world goes round
And sometimes your heart breaks
With a deafing sound
Somebody loses, and somebody wins
And one day it's kicks then it's kicks in the shins
But the planet spins
And the world goes round
And round and round and round and round
The world goes round
And round
And round
And round
