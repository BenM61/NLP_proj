Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you sing it
Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you sing it

You hold the key in the palm of your hand use it
Don't blame your life on the master plan change it
Only you generate the power to decide what to do with your life
You're a fool if you think your helpless you control what you do with your life

Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you sing it
Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you sing it

You don't like the way your living to bad
You can't change your life because it's out of your hand so sad
So you sit on your pants and holler
'Cause the world ain't been treating you right
Don't you know you contain the power to control destiny with your mind
