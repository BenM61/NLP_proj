The lights in all the cities have now gone
Restless hearts and minds are moving on
Baby take the best escape for all
Dunno if I'm coming back for more

Burning up again
I found my only friend
Burning up again
I found my only friend

Got to feel inside the orange sun
No hold on the borders till it's fun
Race to please you if you start to roll,
Vanity and time will rape my soul

Burning up again
I found my only friend
Burning up again
I found my only friend

Burning up again
I found my only friend
Burning up again
I found my only friend
