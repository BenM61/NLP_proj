Every Sunday
I go to Hollywood
I buy my ticket
To see the midnight show

And every Sunday
I live my honeymoon
You rule my body
I just feel how it's good

My mind aches
You bust my real thoughts
When you're with me
'Til the night's away I am sittin'

I watch the fireworks
It's no matter of time
I feel the midnight crush
Feelin' without knowing the other

Tonight, let me handle this affair
Let me handle this affair
There's no ending
Light fades in my eyes

I don't want nobody
To burn my Hollywood
Every Sunday
I go to Hollywood

It's worth waitin' 
To see the midnight show
And every Sunday
I live my honeymoon

You rule my body
I just feel how it's good
Feelin' without knowing the other
Tonight, let me handle this affair

Let me handle this affair
