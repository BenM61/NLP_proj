Kill, kill, then you drill for our tanks just to fill and blind to deceive
And all this blackness is just white lies and red in streets

You purge, burn, let it pour red
Into this bloodbath hell instead
This is our darkest hour, hatred is what's feeding the power

Circle of demons
Feed on liberty
Circle of demons
Sadist of the free

I stand before you today as my rights are being raped
I pledge a f*ck-you to the demons of the united states

This is corrupt
You are damned
Well, hell reigns on earth now
Blood on the cross
Is now on the virgin

The money will control, in a sense, innocence, in cents
The dice that you must fight just to roll
In a sense, innocence, in cents

Taking from the severed hand of innocence
'Cause everyone that's here is damned

Circle of demons

The money will control, in a sense, innocence, in cents
The dice that you must fight just to roll
In a sense, innocence, in cents

The blood is beginning to flow
Drink up because greed and war is now what we know
Oh, what they need we don't have to show
We're taking their rights, won't put up a fight
Feed on the innocents in the night
We are the demons who gloat our might
We are the demons who feed in the night

This is corrupt
You are damned
Well, hell reigns on earth now
Blood on the crust is now pouring from the virgin

Kill, kill, then you drill for our tanks just to fill and blind to deceive
And all this blackness is just white lies and red in streets

You purge, burn, let it pour red
Into the bloodbath hell instead
This is our darkest hour, hatred is what's feeding the power
