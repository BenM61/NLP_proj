Take off your shoes now
You've come a long way
You walked all these miles
And now you're in the right place

This is your party
Everyone came
Everyone's smiling
And singing your name

And the nightmares and monsters
Your biggest fears
Seem lightyears away
No, they won't find you here

I'll hold your hand, my dear
Make sure no one's gonna wake you
Tomorrow you'll still be here
No matter where your dreams will take you

And you realize
All the falls and flights
All the sleepless nights
All the smiles and sighs
They brought you here
They only brought you home

Put down this suitcase
This weapon of yours
The struggle is over
You don't need it no more
You can't remember lonely
You forgot about bored
And nothing's the same
Since you walked through this door

This roof is a blanket
That's keeping you warm
Inside the silence
After the storm

I'll hold your hand, my dear
Make sure no one's gonna wake you
Tomorrow you'll still be here
No matter where your dreams will take you

And you realize
All the falls and flights
All the sleepless nights
All the smiles and sighs
They brought you here
They only brought you home

And you understand
This neverending dance
This fight, a fading sense
Now it all makes sense
It brought you here
It only brought you home

Take off your shoes now
You've come a long way
Walked all these miles and I'm in the right place
