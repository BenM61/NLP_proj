All the grass is greener everywhere you look
So many girls out there I could write a book
That one's ass is leaner
This one's like Serena
But I think your silhouette is meaner

And even though you've got small breasts
But to me they look the best
I confess
I wanna go home and get you undressed

See your problems of self esteem
Can be self-fulfilling prophecies
So probably your best policy is to talk to me

Stop looking over your shoulder
'Cause if it was up to me I would make you feel right

Stop looking over your shoulder
'Cause if it was up to me I would make you feel right

All the grass is greener everywhere you look
So many people stare they got you scared of the girls out there
This one's cola-bottle size
And that one's more of a model size
I know you heard this a hundred times
To me what matters is what's inside
And a little backside too
Is that bad, is that taboo?
Can I get a bird's eye view?

You see, your problems of self-esteem
Could be self-fulfilling prophecies
So arguably your best policy should be talking to me
Talking to me

Stop looking over your shoulder
'Cause if it was up to me I would make you feel right

Stop looking over your shoulder
'Cause if it was up to me I would make you feel right

So next time that you're feeling down
Turn your frown into a crown
Put yourself in an evening gown
And I'll roll around
Rip it off
Break you off
JetBlue Airways taking off
Couple of days where the sand is soft
Oh, aren't you glad you took the weekend off?

'Cause it's those little imperfections that make beauty in my eyes
I wanna be in the intersection of your thighs
And you worry about your size
It's nonsense
It's not a contest
And besides
If it was a contest, you'd win it
I wanna take a bath with you in it
Bathroom sex, you in it
I did it, I mind
I'll do it with you if you wanna try
I've seen you cracking a smile
Guess I have to stay for a while

Stop looking over your shoulder
'Cause if it was up to me I would make you feel right

Over your shoulder
Love is what you're searching for
Over your shoulder
You don't have to look anymore
