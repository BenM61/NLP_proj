I woke up bright and early this mornin'
My little girl was not in sight
I been lookin' everywhere
Mornin', noon and daylight

'Cause she's so fine 
She's so fine
Well she's so fine 
Oh, she's so fine, you know I wish she was mine

I've got somethin' to tell her
And maybe she'll listen, maybe not
But I loved that woman like never before
'Cause all my love she's got

Well, she's so fine 
She's so fine
Well, she's so fine 
Woah-ho, she's so fine, you know I wish she was mine, ah, c'mon
Harry

One
Two
Three
Six, sorry, Harry

Well she's so fine 
She's so fine
Well she's so fine 
Oh-oh she's so fine, you know I wish she was mine, ah c'mon
Oh yeah, a-c'mon-on

Well, she's so fine 
She's so fine
Yeah she's so fine
Oh, she's so fine, you know I wish she was mine, I want more
Hey, let's go, I want more

Hmm, yeah, she's so fine 
She's so fine
Ah well, she's so fine
Oh, she's so fine, you know I wish she was mine
And that's all
