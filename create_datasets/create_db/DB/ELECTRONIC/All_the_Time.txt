Early in the morning's when I think about you
I hit you like what you sayin'
And the morning when I wanna f*ck you
Yeah, I hit you like what you sayin'
I could f*ck you all the time
I could f*ck you all the time

M-O-E-T
That's what the f*ck we be sippin
That's what the f*ck be drippin
My Trap house still tippin
Face time on the go
She gave me dome from the distance
She love to climb on top
But she love to walk off limping
Pimps up, hoes down
Legs up or toes down
Why she jock me, cause she knocked knee'd
And we got trees, so many go around
Gotta know I ate her
She so sweet now and later
I want that all the time, all the time
I know you all mine'

Early in the morning's when I think about you
I hit you like what you sayin'
In the morning when I wanna f*ck you
Yeah, I hit you like what you sayin'
I could f*ck you all the time
I could f*ck you all the time

Pu-pu-pussy for breakfast, that's how I start my day
My d*ck is a pen, it's written all over her face
I put my tongue in her mouth, I make her pussy lips drool
She got that junk in the trunk, you know I like junk food
I tell her like this: life is good
Your pussy better, but I put on her magnum
I could go and melt her
And if it's sweeter, I'ma eat it till I get sugar diabetes
I'm her blood and she anemic we perfect!

Early in the morning's when I think about you
I hit you like what you sayin'
In the morning when I wanna f*ck you
(Oh yeah I make her say)
Yeah, I hit you like what you sayin'
I could f*ck you all the time
I could f*ck you all the time

Damn, damn long momma you're sticky
Got a nigga out feeling Wicky
Every time you put it on me man ' trip
Every time we on it we eat fit, fit, fit
Don't let the time pick you
Wanna snap my finger, '
(Head shots)
Feeling real tipsy, getting real freaky
And it's getting real frisky
She melts it down, then she so calm
Up and down that wall, she go cold
F*ck me like you hate me, kiss me like you miss me
Anything I want to, it's what she always left me

Early in the morning's when I think about you
I hit you like what you sayin'
In the morning when I wanna f*ck you
(Oh yeah I make her say)
Yeah, I hit you like what you sayin'
I could f*ck you all the time
I could f*ck you all the time
