Shorty! 
What you mad for?
I don't know too many that go to sleep in Chanel and wake up in Fendi
You know what it was before you hopped inside my Bentley
And everything was good as long as I kept spending
But I'm gonna keep it hood, see you I can do without it
You wonder why we call you bitch, think about it
Go holler at your man, maybe he can support ya
Love don't live here , I ain't got nothin' for ya

First things first girl stick that attitude in your purse
Straighten up your face before I pull over
Ain't nothing cute about walkin' home from work
Check yourself
Now number two
You're my only lady baby, that's the truth
So you can sit and pout until your face turn blue
I will kill a brick and drown a drop of water about you
But there's one thing I can't do

[Chorus]
Can't force you, I can't force you
To slow down slow down slow down
You're my one and only I ain't tryin' to mess around
You're just trippin', you gotta
Slow down slow down slow down 
Can't force you, I can't force you
To slow down slow down slow down
You're my one and only I ain't tryin' to mess around
You're just trippin', you gotta
Slow down

When I was a tyke
A brother taught himself how to ride a bike
But once I got the hang of it I rode all night
I said that to say
This relationship is gonna have it's good and bad days
It's like fallin' off and getting back on again
But no poppin' wheelies til we got our balance
I can't handle this

[Chorus]

What up with all these allegations
Shorty all is well
Accusations about my situation, callin' my cell
Take a step back, relax, chill, pause exhale
You're the reason I ain't got no bars on my cell
You must think I'm in this booth spittin' these bars for my health
For every action there's a reaction , cause and effect
Good times and bad 
Times and bad times, whatever cards are dealt
You need some help 'cause I 

[Chorus]
