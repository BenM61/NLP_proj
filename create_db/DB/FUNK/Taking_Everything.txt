To my heart
To my car
To my crib
My kids, everything

Never thought you bring me so much pain
Lord knows I tried to keep you happy, girl in every way
I'm on the road doing my thing, trying to keep you laced
Trying to keep a smile upon your face, girl

Put all my happiness in vain
Or did I place in you a little too much faith
Now I'm left with memories
Never thought that this would be the price I had to pay

You took my heart (yes you did)
You took my car (yes)
You took my crib, yes, you did (yes you did)
Got the nerve to take my kids
Got the nerve to take my kids

Took my love (all my love) 
And my life (all my life)
Girl, you took my soul (all of my soul)
Taking everything from me
Taking everything from me

You took my heart, girl, you took my car
And you took my crib, tryin' to take my kids
Girl, you took my love, then you took my soul
Taking everything, everything, everything, everything, 
Everything!

And now I'm sitting all alone
Trying to figure out where you and I went wrong
You know it makes me wanna cry
Just thinking about it makes me wanna lay down and die

For the life of me I don't know how
That you could take for granted and disregard our sacred vows
Now I'm left with memories
Never thought that this would be the price I'd have to pay

You took my heart
Girl, you took my, my car
Tryin' to take my crib, girl
You got the nerve to take my kids
Got the nerve to take my kids

And take my love, love, love, love
And my life, girl, you took my soul, yeah
Taking everything from me
Taking everything from me

You took my heart, my car
My car
(Crib) my crib, my, my kids, my kids
My love, soul
Everything, everything, everything, everything
Everything

Now I ain't never been no fool
I've always tried to keep my cool
I was faithful and true, never bruised you or used you
Even though sometimes you make me want to but I loved you

You should try to understand, girl, I was your man
My life was in your hands, baby, my love 
Was shinning over there but this wasn't part of your plan
No, no, no, no

What about the plans we had?
Now you're gone and I'm just gonna be a weekend dad, baby
Can I call you baby? Or is that just a passing thing, babe
Listen to this sad song I sing, yeah
What about the ring, what about the ring? Oh, ho

Now you going away in my car
Girl, you can have the crib
But won't you give me back my kids
How am I supposed to live?
Oh baby, without love, without love, babe
She given me (my life)

All my life, all my life I'd thought we'd live forever
Said we'd be together
And you would never, never, never, never, never never, never, ever, ever, leave, me

Take my
Heart, crib, cars, kids, love, life, souls from me
My cars, heart, crib, kids, my kids and now
You would never, never, never leave me, oh (my heart)

Cars
Crib, my kids
My love, life
Every
You took everything
