Measure for measure
Your loves so much pleasure
Like a haunting melody
You came inside and captured me

And I'm so happy
you're the rhythm of my rhyme
You and I together
Well stand the test of time

You know how to love me (Sure you do)
You know to make it right (So nice)
You know how to love me (Theres no denyin)
Sweet as the morning light

Sooner or later
I knew you'd come my way
you're welcome to my love
Just promise that you'll stay

You know how to love me
Right in a special way
You know how to love me
Tonight all I want to say
You know how to love me
you're the real that I feel, never go away

Seeings believin
don't you know you're a dream come true
ain't nothin deceivin
Bout the way that I'm lovin you, yeah

You know how to love me (You know, you know)
You know to make it right (I can feel it)
You know how to love me (No doubt about it)
Sweet as the morning light

Nothings forever
that's what people say
But each time were together
Forever and a day

You know how to love me
Right in a special way
You know how to love me
Tonight all I want to say
You know how to love me
you're the real that I feel, never go away

You know how to love me (Oh, you know that you do)
(You know how to love me, baby)
Ooh, you know to make it right (Oh, I know you do, whoa)
Ooh, you know how to love me
(Seeings believin, don't you know you're a dream come true, yeah)
Ooh, you know how to love me (Oh, oh, baby)
(Who will take this heart of mine) Ooh, you know how to love me
(Love me, baby, all the time, come on, give it to me, baby)
(You know how to love) Ooh, you know how to love me
(You know how)
