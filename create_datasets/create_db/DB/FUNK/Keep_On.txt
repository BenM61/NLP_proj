What secret plans still lie ahead
Locked up behind closed walls
What they have said
For all we know
To them it's simply news
Through the heroes of our peopl0e
Vanished long ago
All the lessons that they taught still live to
Keep us strong, so

Keep on
Believing in our world
Togetherness with hope
There's nothing we can't build
Keep on
Knowing that it's right
Sharing with our brothers we can see
The light
Shine (see it shine)

How many politicians try to cover up
Their lies
And in the blackness of the night
Abuse us with their might
It's the sadness of it all that makes us
Stand and fight, so

With his hands
The farmer works the land
Dedicated for the earth to grow
In the streets
The people make ends meet
It's their reality
Through the heroes of our people
Vanished long ago
All the lessons that they taught still live to
Keep us strong
We'll hold on
