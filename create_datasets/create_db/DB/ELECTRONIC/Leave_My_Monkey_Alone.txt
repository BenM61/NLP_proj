Mzungu Arudi Ulaya Mwa Frika Apate Uhuru 
(Whites go back to Europe; Freedom for Africa)

Leave my monkey alone 
Leave my monkey alone 
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone

Down in Kenya, where the Masai roam 
And the grass grows tall on the veldt 
In our old colonial home
We drank our bitters while the empire fell

Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone 
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone

One day the Mau Mau came 
All we had was lost 
In our old colonial home
Under the Southern Cross

Leave my monkey alone 
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone 
Leave my monkey alone

Down in Kenya, where the Masai roam 
And the grass grows tall on the veldt 
In our old colonial home 
We drank our bitters while the empire fell

Leave my monkey alone 
Leave my monkey alone 
Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone

The Mau Mau came in fifty-two 
The sun went down, and we drew the drapes
In our old colonial home
We hid behind the Mau Mau gates

Leave my monkey alone
Leave my monkey alone 
Leave my monkey alone 
Leave my monkey alone
