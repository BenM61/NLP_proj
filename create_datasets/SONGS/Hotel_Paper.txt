I write mostly on Hotel Paper
Knowing that my thoughts will never leave this room
I'd be out of line telling you, "leave her"
So I lie lonely surrounded by you
By you

Lately I can't be happy for no one
They think I need some time to myself
I try to smile but I can't remember
And I know tomorrow there'll be nothing else

And I wanted to be giving you everything that she's not giving
And I wanted to see
'Cause I didn't believe what I'd been hearing

You turned out to be more than I bargained for
And I can tell that you need to get away
Forgive me if I admit that I'd love to love you
We both realized it way too late

And I wanted to be
Giving you everything that she's not giving
And I wanted to see
'Cause I didn't believe what I'd been hearing

Maybe this wind blowing in just came from the ocean
