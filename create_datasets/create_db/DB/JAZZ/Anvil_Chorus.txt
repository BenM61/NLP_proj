Summer, you old Indian Summer
You're the tear that comes after June times laughter
You see so many dreams that don't come true
Dreams we fashioned when summer time was new

You are here to watch over
Some heart that is broken
By a word that somebody left unspoken
You're the ghost of a romance in June

Going astray, fading too soon
That's why I say, "Farewell to you, Indian Summer!"
