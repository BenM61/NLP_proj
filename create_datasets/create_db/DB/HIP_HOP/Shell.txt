Just a shell until you decide to rebel
Just a shell until you decide to rebel
Just a shell until you decide to rebel
Just a shell until you decide to rebel
Just a shell, just a shell, just a shell until you decide to rebel
Whether you're white or black your soul does not dwell
Inside your shell until you decide to rebel
Worldly worldy people people allow your innersides
To intervene and circulate
Open your eyes and open your ears
Wouldn't it be great.
So what am I doing? Am I really rebellin' or am I just dwelling
In the sin
In the sin
In the sin?
I've made up my mind
I've seen the design of individualism
And I don't want to be in it
The me generation's a disease!
