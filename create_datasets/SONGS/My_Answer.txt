Now I received your letter saying you were sorry
And you wanted to come on home to me
(And this is my answer oh oh)
So I decided to answer and tell you baby
Things ain't what they used to be
(Cause' I was hurt, hurt, hurt)
You see I found me someone else
That I believe appreciate my loving good
(And this is my answer oh oh)
And I'm not gonna mistreat them for you because
Things didn't go the way you thought they would
(Cause' I was hurt, hurt, hurt)
Now all I can say, hey, hey, hey
(Oh who I'm sorry for you, oh)

For forty days and nights you made me suffer
Before you called back on the telephone
(That really hurt, hurt, hurt)
But I know you was just brainwashed baby
And you couldn't give it up and come on home
(And here is my answer)
So I finally fell on my knees when I realized
Your love, you didn't want me to have it
(Cause' I been hurt, hurt, hurt)
And I felt so close to you love
I felt like I could just reach and grab it
(And this is my answer, oh oh)
Now all I can say, hey, hey, hey
(Oh who I'm sorry for you, oh)

Now you said right here in your letter
That you lied and said I did you wrong
(And this is my answer, oh oh)
You know you didn't care if I lived or died baby
Or worried about how I got along
(That really hurt, hurt, hurt)
So just before I close my letter
Remember I said one day you'd be
(You would be crying)
Broken-hearted and worried baby
Without a love just like me
(And this is my answer, oh oh)
Now all I can say, hey, hey, hey
(Oh who I'm sorry for you, oh)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
