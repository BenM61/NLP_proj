Dig this crazy mood I'm in
Listen to my heart as it starts to spin
Wish
When you kiss me, and do it again
I'm in a frenzy. 

Watch my eyes, when you light them up
Bling
Listen to me whine, like a harpsichord
When you touch me I warm right up
I'm in a frenzy. 

This love gushes from my heart
Like a water from a spout
You build a flame, from a tiny spark
You can really knock me out. 

Yeah 

Ease my mind with your real cool lines
Daddy, fill my soul with love divine
When you say you're mine, all mine
I'm in a Frenzy. 

This love gushes from my heart
Like a water from a spout
You build a flame, from a tiny spark
You can really knock me out.

Yeah

Ease my mind with your real cool lines
Daddy, fill my soul with love divine
When you say you're mine, all mine
I'm in a frenzy.

Frenzy
