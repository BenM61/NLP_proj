You got your big girl
Now you've got your young one too
Wondering if some day
I could have them
The way I once had you
I remember your crazy remarks
We'd get drunk and go out after dark
Searching for someone we could take home

You don't wanna be alone
You don't want to see the sun go down
You don't wanna open the door
And see her go
One step and tomorrow comes
Two steps and she's off with someone
Three steps and it's all you know
You'll be gone, she'll be gone

So what are you gonna do about me
I'll be there when you have no one else
Spotted the old man in the south
Hold it in, I'll be there, be your friend

Hold on strong, don't let go
There will never be no one to take your place
So don't you want to reach out and take my hand

You don't wanna be alone
You don't want to see the sun go down
You don't wanna open the door and see her go
One step and tomorrow comes
Two steps and she's off with someone
Three steps and it's all you know
You'll be gone, she'll be gone

You don't wanna be alone
You don't want to see the sun go down
You don't wanna open the door
And see her go, see her go
One step and tomorrow comes
Two steps and she's off with someone
Three steps and it's all you know
You'll be gone, she'll be gone

One step and tomorrow comes
Two steps and she's off with someone
Three steps and it's all you know
You'll be gone, she'll be gone
