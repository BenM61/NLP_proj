What we share was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like
What we share was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like, ouch

Six thirty in the morning, I've arrived early from tour
Step into the house, I'm walking up the stairs
1 step, 2 step, 3 step, 4

I'm on the second floor, I'm opening the door
I could not brace myself for what I saw
Who's this woman in my bed, name's Shaniqua and what?
Na, get the hell up off my baby

Now she the type of lady that every man needs
She's straight up feisty
She keeps me on my feet
But I don't wanna *** things by sex

There's some other hoe in our bed
What are you take me for?
To hell with you, to hell with me
Yeah, I never wanna see your face again

Where the *** do you think you is going, going?
I loved you so much but you cheated on me
What we shared was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like, ouch

It used to be the other way around but
The story changed, my heart is breaking
You need to recognize she was just a, ah
I think it's time for me to go

Semi brown skin beauty had to get it back
I understand she's upset, she wants to kick and slap
But you say I'm from the slum I wouldn't never stand for that, think
Underneath the bridge with that fake looking twat

Now remember when we were financially unstable
Channel 1 to 5, no Sky or cable
Had to do some dirty work in order to be able
To take care of you and put food on the table

Actions speak louder then words, I can't blame her for wanting the worse
She might be wishing that I'm dead, but I know she don't mean it
Think when I found those Nike's, I couldn't believe it

Remember when we had the feds knocking at our door
You took care of the stash and hid the money from the draw
You done the right thing 'cause they had me up on the floor
So you saved me from getting five years or more

Now she the type of lady that every man needs
She's straight up feisty
She keeps me on my feet
But I don't wanna *** things by sex

There's some other hoe in our bed
What are you take me for?
To hell with you, to hell with me
Yeah, I never wanna see your face again

Where the *** do you think you is going, going?
I loved you so much but you cheated on me
What we shared was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like, ouch

It used to be the other way around but
The story changed, my heart is breaking
You need to recognize she was just a, ah
I think it's time for me to go

See how's we supposed to solve the situation?
When we're both as stubborn as each other
We would argue for hours over something dumb
What the ***? Conversation done

Our ego trips never help us get nowhere
You should know this by now
When you shout I smile, when you hit me I laugh
I get all cocky like, go run me a bath

So you wanna play it like that, but baby, I can get back
You don't wanna feel my, ouch, ouch, ouch
I've done it before, I'll do it again
Just leave me alone

Where the *** do you think you is going, going?
I loved you so much but you cheated on me
What we shared was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like, ouch

It used to be the other way around but
The story changed, my heart is breaking
You need to recognize she was just a, ah
