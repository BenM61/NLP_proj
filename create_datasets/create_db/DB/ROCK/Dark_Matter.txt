Tired of looking in the mirror
Cracks separate my face
I'm not what you think
I'm lost in make believe
But why, oh God why are you doing this to me?

Can't stop looking out my window
I don't know who I am anymore
You'll wash, wash away all the secrets of my past
The shattered reflection is all I ever had

These are my last days cause hell has been calling for me
Why am I crazy why am I crazy?
I am a disease and hell has been calling for me
Why am I crazy why am I crazy?

Devour the darkness
Hell find me
Light defies me
Devour the darkness
Light won't find me

These are my last days cause hell has been calling for me
Why am I crazy why am I crazy?
I am a disease and hell has been calling for me
Why am I crazy why am I crazy?

I'm not crazy
I'm not crazy
I'm not crazy

These are my last days cause hell has been calling for me
Why am I crazy why am I crazy?
I am a disease and hell has been calling for me
Why am I crazy why am I crazy?
