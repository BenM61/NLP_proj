Long distance last goodbye 
Can't give it one last try 
It's all over we didn't even cry 
All I know is the world came between us and the love got left behind 
No news flash funeral half mast flag on the day that our love died 
And I'd tell you face to face but I can't look you in the eye 
I just called to say goodbye 
Did you burn my pictures yet
Anything to try and forget 
It's all I can do just to stay on the line
All I know is the world came between us and the love got left behind 
No news flash funeral half mast flag on the day that our love died 
And I'd tell you face to face but I can't look you in the eye 
I just called to say goodbye 
We both know how hard it is for both of us to try and we both know how hot it is
In Richmond in July 
So what am I supposed to say? 
How's the weather anyway? 
This time I called to say goodbye 
Who'd thought it would end like this? 
With out even a good bye kiss no one can say we didn't try.
