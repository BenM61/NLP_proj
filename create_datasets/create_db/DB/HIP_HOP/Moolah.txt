All my life I hustled just to get that mula
And stack my change up, then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work

All I ever had was the cocaine
My cousin Lebron was the dope man
In the GT switchin' four lanes
From the stove with the coca like propane
On the block where the shots go "bang!"
Only real niggas really gon' hang
All my life, you was saved by the bell
I was saved by the cocaine, ay!
Young boys with choppers, young boys with lawyers
We stand in the kitchen and whip out that work

All my life I hustled just to get that mula
And stack my change up, then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work

All my life I hustled just to get that mula
And stack my change up, then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work

Got the trap house bumpin'
First of the month when the kids run
Got the whole block jumping on fire
Need on ring when I come through
Addicted to mula, no favors
This feel like a hell of a day bro
I'm falling in love with that coco
Think she run in my veins and my whole soul
Got the whole block in a choke hold
Middle finger to the popo
Cool as a cooler, addicted to mula

All my life I hustled just to get that mula
And stack my change up, then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work

All my life I hustled just to get that mula
And stack my change up, then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work

All my life I hustled just to get that mula
And stack my change up, then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work

All my life I hustled just to get that mula
And stack my change up, then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work

All my life I hustled just to get that mula
And stack my change up, then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work

All my life I hustled just to get that mula
And stack my change up, then go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
