I believe that someone
Can be brave on this green Earth
But maybe I'm wrong
Mhm maybe I'm wrong
Game on

Turns dreams to reality
The king of principality shines upon me
The Holy Spirit shadows me
I write songs for fun, not for salary
Used to collect guns, now the truth is my Calvary
But I got a closet full
Just in case the project pulls
Some wicked bullshit
My logistic is logical
Turn you back to molecules
Minuscule follicles
Then convert your brain to subatomic particles
I breathe you in, and sneeze you out
You MCs, you live in the crease of doubt
That's why I swarm on your college dorm
Make knowledge born
From the hood to the cottage farm
London to Russia
Eurasia to Prussia
The Holy Cities of the East
The [young sheiks discuss?] us
Christ means crusher
Become along the usher
The righteous way of life
It'd be most wise
For the civilized man to trust us
On Bora Bora we discuss the Torah
Then we travel across these lands like old explorers

I believe that someone
Can be brave on this green Earth
But maybe I'm wrong
Aim for the sun
Out in the freezing rain
Stay on the streets all day
Until my cup runneth over
We always fight blind the light of our lives
My patience is waning, the scales have capsized
I read [?] full of glory
And there's pyres of files of light
Fleeting mazes to the night sky

Sitting on the porch, torching a stoagie, in the moonlight
Rocking back and forth in my chair, contemplating life
Thinking where I went wrong, where I went right
Was it a fast, or a long life?
From my calculation everyday sensational
Every sense was stimulated, pain's occasional
All praises due to the Father
The author
The supreme architect
The one with no partner
He give man the wisdom to be a gardener, carpenter
Preist, or warrior, king, or you could be a scholar
Husband, wife, child, mother, brother, sister, or father
All these things the heart consist of
Keep the planet floating gigantic, like Atlantic oceans
7-ounce [?] reject all Satanic notions
We so elusive

I believe that someone
Can be brave on this green Earth
But maybe I'm wrong
Aim for the sun
Out in the freezing rain
I could stay on the streets all day
Until my cup runneth over
[Runneth over x10]
Now I see there's some way
To be free as a seabird
And maybe I'm gone
Straight for the sun
Out in the freezing rain
Stay on the streets all day
Cause my cup runneth over
