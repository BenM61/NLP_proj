So come the evening
I'm out on the dunes
Looking for a token
Something to prove
All I remember
Is more than a flame
In my fantasy fire

Whatever I've done to receive
Whatever I need to redeem
Whatever you say
Even if I wait a lifetime

I know, I swear
If you leave a light on
If you leave a light on for me
I'll come there
You can leave a light on for me

In comes the morning
I'm stood in my track
Looking at the reasons
For me to head back
So unexpected
The kindness you've shown
That I will not forget it

Whatever I've done to receive
Whatever I need to redeem
Whatever you say
Even if I wait a lifetime

I know, I swear
If you leave a light on
If you leave a light on for me
I'll come there
You can leave a light on for me

You breathe the will into the weak
And coax the cage bird to fly free
You ease the lost cause out of me
With your sweet hand to bring me home
I'm not alone

I know, I swear
If you leave a light on
If you leave a light on for me
I'll come there
You can leave a light on for me

I know, I swear
If you leave a light on
If you leave a light on for me
I'll come there
You can leave a light on for me
