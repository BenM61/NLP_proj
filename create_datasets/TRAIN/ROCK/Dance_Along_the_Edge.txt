Sometimes we laugh like children
Go running holding hands
I never felt like this before,
I never will again
Sometimes we cry like babies
I hold you to my heart.
I just can't stand to see you sad,
It tears me all apart
And we're so afraid and it's such a shame,
There is no reason we should doubt it.

The things we want to say we've never said!
And we look away and it's all OK and
Never really talk about it
It's a shame the way we dance along the edge
Dance along the edge.
We always seem so careful,
We're always so unsure.

Our past mistakes they make us shaky, eyes on the door.
When do we stop searching
For what we're searching for?
Then when it comes, we question love and try for more!

And we're happy here, but we live in fear
We've seen a lot of temples crumble.
Some of flesh and blood from love under glass.
Will we come undone? Will we turn and run?
And will we know it when we find it?

It's a game the way we dance along the edge.
And we'll walk the line and we'll do our time
For just as long as we've been given,
And pretend that we don't hear the things they've said.

Can we promise love? Is it all too much
And do our old souls still believe it?
It's insane the way we dance along the edge.
