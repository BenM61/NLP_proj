I pulled in to Nazareth
Was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need some place
Where I can lay my head
"Hey, mister, can you tell me, where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand
And "No" was all he said

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and)
(You put the load right on me)

I picked up my bag
I went looking for a place to hide
I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said "Hey Carmen, come on, let's go downtown?"
And she said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around"

And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And, weight, right on me

Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't ya stay and keep Anna Lee company?"

And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load, yeah
(You put the load right on me)

Catch me a Cannonball, now, to take me down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, I know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free, I say
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
Put the load right on me
Take a load, take a load, take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
Put the weight on me
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
