Here I am back home again
And I'm here to rest
All they ask is where I've been
Knowing I've been west -

I'm the family's unknown boy
Golden curls and envy hair
Pretty girls with faces fair
See the shine in the black sheep boy -

If you love me let me live in peace
And please understand
That the black sheep can wear the golden fleece
And hold the winning hand
