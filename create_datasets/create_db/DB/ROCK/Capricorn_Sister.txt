my loving father, give me no pain
taste of eucalyptus dances and shakes
mother lovebone...mama papa talkin to me
love breeds like rabbits, i'm gonna set you free now
chartreuse regalia and purple pie petes
you dance electra and night become day
got my mama in the kitchen
she always bitchy, bitchy, bitchin
so i made proclamation
to control my masturbation
motherlovebone...mama papa talkin to me
love breeds like rabbits
i'm gonna set you free
burgundy baby
with your blue eyed soul
you play the hits
and i'm on that roll
capricorn sister
freddie mercury
jezebel child cry...etc...
