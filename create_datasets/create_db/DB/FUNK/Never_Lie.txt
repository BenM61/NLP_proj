I will never lie again (I will never lie again)
'Cause you will always be my friend
I will never I will never lie again
'Cause a friend like you
Will last forever

Sitting in my window
Thinking of you
All the fun things we use to do
I feel the pain
Please come back to me
'Cause a friend like you will only
Come once in a lifetime

I will never lie again (I will never lie again)
'Cause you will always be my friend
I will never I will never lie again
'Cause a friend like you
Will last forever

On the phone when you were here
Laughing and joking
Cryin and sulking
In my dreams
Your still with me
'Cause a friend like you will only
Come once in a lifetime

I will never lie again (I will never lie again)
'Cause you will always be my friend
I will never I will never lie again
'Cause a friend like you
Will last forever

When I think of you
I think of someone special
And how it used to be
I know, you'll always be my friend
And I'm so sad it had to end
Oh yeah baby

I will never lie again (I will never lie again)
'Cause you will always be my friend
I will never I will never lie again
'Cause a friend like you
Will last forever
