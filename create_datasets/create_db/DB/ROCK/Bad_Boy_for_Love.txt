Thirty days in the county jail
Let me out and I just wanted to wail
Some fool tried to hold me down
I got drunk and I ripped up the town

I'm a bad boy, a bad boy for love
I'm a bad boy, a bad boy for love

Well I, I went around just to see my chick
I found her room and it was candle lit
She's makin' love to another man
I shot 'em both and they locked me in the slam

I'm a bad boy, a bad boy for love
I'm a bad boy, a bad boy for love

Mmm bad, so bad

Well I, I heard the the word there was a local break
It was a chance I just had to take
I jumped the wall and I was on the run
They came after me with a thousand guns

Cause I'm a bad boy, a bad boy for love
I'm a bad boy, a bad boy for love

Yeah I'm a bad boy, a bad boy for love
Yeah I'm a bad boy, a bad boy for love

Honey I'm bad, thirty years mama
In the county jail,
