New shit, Joe featuring Nas

[Nas]
Hey yo, Joe
Here's another one
To involve Nas
They drool on the blue jewels on the arm
To cool in the palms still move to this song
Been a minute since I heard some new Joe
'Cause dog is crazy R and B cujo
And now I'm a rap psycho
Norman Bates call it mama
With the brown in lama
But I ain't in town for no drama
Just peep it, shorty 
Peep me so I'm on ya

[Joe]
In the club deep wit' all of my crew
Saturday nights - it just what we do
Just enjoying the good life
It's all right in here
When I turn around I see
A sexy mommy starin' at me
I already know what she's thinking
She wants me tonight, yeah

[Chorus:]
I see you lookin' at me naughty
Come over and get to know me
Tell me what it is you're sippin'
I slip it up; I got the bar
Maybe if you get to know me
Then maybe we can leave this party
Oh, you got a sexy body
Come over and get to know me

[Joe]
You're so damn hot, girl, you're makin' me sweat
You gotta round thing that I can't forget
From yo' hips all the way to yo' chest
Looks so good
I must say that I'm impressed
You should thank God 'cause you've been blessed
Come here so I can get in yo' head
Don't be shy

[Joe]
Come over, come over
Come over, come over
Come over, come over
Come over, come over
And get to know me

[Chorus x 2]

[Nas]
Yeah, baby, I know why you're here, I know what you thinking
But I ain't saying nothin'
Great minds think alike; you intelligent species
We already connect through telekinesis
Plus my gear direct the monkey jeans on
One pair fifteen, huh, crisp clean air ones
I'm thinking you can be my sparkle
Maybe my paw - they ain't raisin' my offspring
The Haitians let you taste the algae
The grapes are sent from maple valley
Your waist is slim; it must be Balley's
Ya killin' me soft like old school Albe

[Chorus x 2]

Come over and get to know me
You're gonna like what you see
Oh, oh, oh, ah, aw, yeah
Come over here
Come
Come over here
Come over here, baby
Come over here
