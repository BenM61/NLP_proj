I was climbing, now I'm falling
I've been pushed off by a man
Who has made it to the top
And now defends it 'cause he can
And I have found a breach in his front line

I was open, now I'm hidden
From the danger of his words
I have found a good position
And I'll play for what he's worth, and he will find
Nowhere left to hide

I will lift her love and I'll break your spirit
I will dig a hole and I'll throw you in it
Only time will tell if we're all just cynics on the run
If we're all just cynics come undone

I was losing, now we're drawing
I'm not afraid to draw my blood
I'm not backing down
So I'd surrender 'cause you should
And face the truth
You raise the flag, I'll tear it down
Though you may have won the battle

But I'll take the fight to you
And your flag is on the ground
And your bones they rattle too
'Cause I'll break you
Your fear has now come true

I will lift her love and I'll break your spirit
I will dig a hole and I'll throw you in it
Only time will tell if we're all just cynics on the run
If we're all just cynics come undone
All just waiting for the gun
We are tied to the truth
The tie that binds me to you
I'm acting on my words
With all that I have heard
With honesty in mind
You will find
That I'm not the liar
See the truth in my eyes
No, I'm not the liar
See the truth in my eyes

I will lift her love and I'll break your spirit
I will dig a hole and I'll throw you in it
Only time will tell if we're all just cynics on the run

I will lift her love and I'll break your spirit
I will dig a hole and I'll throw you in it
Only time will tell if we're all just cynics on the run
If we're all just cynics come undone
