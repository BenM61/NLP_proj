Pray to the future
Look to the past
Face the accuser
Freeze in our tracks
So many children
Have fallen from grace
The door should be open
No scorn or disgrace

Keys have been stolen
Treasure is lost
Lesson is golden
Hearts have been crossed
So here's to the heros
Come one and come all
Without them well who knows
Well who knows at all

In these days of no trust
Evermore hostility
We're all living under the same old sky
We're all living telling the same old lie
In these days of no trust

And music recorded
Might influence dreams
But headlines are courted
By stretch limosines
Pictures of plenty
Are stuck to the wall
For heads that are empty
Brains on the floor
Can't take any more

Someone is shouting
Revolution is here
He'll climb any mountain
For his selfish career
The truth's not a curtain
To be drawn back and forth
It's a flame that keeps burning
Everlasting touch

In these days of no trust
Evermore hostility
We're all living under the same old sky
We're all living telling the same old lie
In these days of no trust
