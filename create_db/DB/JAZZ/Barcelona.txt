Barcelona
Take me back to Barcelona
Where did you go? God only knows

Is it too late to find you, are you out there?
Know you're out there somewhere tonight
In that same dress, with that same look in your eyes
Is it too late to tell you how I felt about you?
On that one night when we undressed
And we jumped in, can I confess? (Shit)

I might've been in love with you
I might've been the one for you
Now you're the one that got away
I never even got your name, Miss

Barcelona
Take me back to Barcelona (Oh, oh)
Where did you go? God only knows
Oh, Miss Barcelona
Take me back to Barcelona (Oh, oh)
Where did you go? God only knows
Take me back to Barcelona

Girl, I hope you feel the same
So much more between us than this ocean and these waves
No FC, no Messi; we kicked it for the day
We met in Barcelona, had to go our separate ways
Baby, I know you still think about that night
Or maybe I'm naive, just holding on to you and me
Only got like two or three hours with you before I had to
Hit the road onto the next, I guess we'll never know

I might've been in love with you
I might've been the one for you
Now you're the one that got away
I never even got your name, Miss

Barcelona
Take me back to Barcelona (Oh, oh)
Where did you go? God only knows
Oh, Miss Barcelona
Take me back to Barcelona (Oh, oh)
Where did you go? God only knows
Take me back to Barcelona

(Oh, oh)
Where did you go? God only knows
Take me back to Barcelona, oh
Where did you go? God only knows
Take me back to Barcelona
