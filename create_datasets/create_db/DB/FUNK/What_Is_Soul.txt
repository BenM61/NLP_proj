What is soul? What is soul, babe?

Some few people really know
It's deep within us, it doesn't show
A soul is somethin' that comes from deep inside
But a soul is a somethin' that you can't hide

What is soul? What is soul, babe?

Search your heart, go deep down low
Way down there you'll find your soul
Come near girl, you look so cold
Touch my hand and warm your soul

Baby, baby, what's wrong with you
You don't know what I'm going through
Hold me so tight, so tight I can't breath
Can't you feel it girl? Don't you know what I mean?
This is soul!

This is soul! Feel the soul, babe!
What is soul, babe? Don't you know?
What is soul, babe?
