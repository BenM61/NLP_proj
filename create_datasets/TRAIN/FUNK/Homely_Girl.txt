It must have broke your poor little heart 
When the boys used to say, 
You looked better in the dark. 
Oooh but now they'd give all they learnt in school 
To be somewhere in the dark with you (Oh yes they would) 

You know the teacher would ask the questions 
And you, would always raise your hand 
Oooh but somehow you never got your turn 
And my eyes would fill with water, inside I'd burn (Oh yes I did)


Homely girl, She was so lonely 
You're a beautiful woman oh yes lonely girl  
Homely girl you used to be lonely 
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah 

There was a boy who used to sit beside you 
Who'd like to hold that place his whole life through 
Oooh you were beautiful to me 
You had a heart no one could ever see, oh yes you did 

I was the only one who offered 
To carry your books 
Took all the stares and laughter 
With the dirty looks 
But I saw then what they see now 
They all want to ask you for a date 
They don't know how, they don't know how 


Homely girl, She was so lonely 
You're a beautiful woman oh yes lonely girl  
Homely girl you used to be lonely 
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah 

Oooh first they want a chance to hold you
Then they want a chance to try to control you
Oh no, don't you know I got to say it
