Wakin' up to find another day
The moon got lost again last night
But now the sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel all right

But it hurts when I think, when I let it sink in
It's all over me I'm lying here in the dark
Watchin' you sleep; it hurts a lot

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up
Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I wanna make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

All I wanted was to know I'm safe
Don't wanna lose the love I found
Remember when you said that you would change?
Don't let me down

It's not fair, how you are
I can't be complete, can you give me more?

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up
Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I wanna make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

Oh, please, you know what I need
Save all your lovin' for me
We can't escape the love
Give me everything that you have

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up
Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I wanna make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right
