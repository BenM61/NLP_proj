This town is his cause burying my neck
This air it takes off, without rushing, without haste

The streets are in distress,
The sun suffocates behind darkened skies
The grass is growing under my feet
I'm thinking it wont be long before you get

The line-up seems endless,
Underneath the salvation sign
We are the dead ones, we are the lost cause
We are the people who will not blame ourselves from this cause

The city, the city is haunted,
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
There's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls)

Every step I take,
I leave a small piece of myself behind
Soon there will be nothing left

The cracks in the pavement,
Match the cracks in their weathered skin,
The skies a brick wall, the clouds a juggernaut
Each day as we know
I stare in amazement, I can't believe this is where I live
Every breath I take, I feel my lungs fail

The city, the city is haunted,
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
There's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls)

Our steps seal fate
Our steps seal fate
(this is our celebration, come join the lost souls)
(this is our celebration, come join the lost souls)

The city, the city is haunted
Walk with us

The city, the city is haunted,
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
There's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls)
