I was sayin' let me out of here before I was
Even born, it's such a gamble when you get a face
It's fascinatin' to observe what the mirror does
But when I dine it's for the wall that I set a place

I belong to the blank generation and
I can take it or leave it each time, well
I belong to the generation but
I can take it or leave it each time

Triangles were fallin' at the window as the doctor cursed
He was a cartoon long forsaken by the public eye
The nurse adjusted her garters as I breathed my first
The doctor grabbed my throat and yelled, "God's consolation prize!"

I belong to the blank generation and
I can take it or leave it each time, well
I belong to the generation but
I can take it or leave it each time

To hold the T.V. to my lips, the air so packed with cash
Then carry it up flights of stairs and drop it in the vacant lot
To lose my train of thought and fall into your arms' tracks
And watch beneath the eyelids every passing dot

I belong to the blank generation and
I can take it or leave it each time, well
I belong to the generation but
I can take it or leave it each time

I belong to the blank generation and
I can take it or leave it each time, well
I belong to the generation but
I can take it or leave it each time
