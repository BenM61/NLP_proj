There must have been some magician
That old silk hat they found
Cause when they put it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman was a fairytale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magician
That old silk hat they found
Cause when they put it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he can be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away

Hippede hop hop hippede hop hop
Look at frosty go
Hippede hop hop hippede hop hop
Over the hills of snow
Hippede hop hop hippede hop hop
Look at frosty go
Hippede hop hop hippede hop hop
Over the hills of snow

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right through the traffic cops
But he only paused a moment when
He heard them holler stop

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
So he waved goodbye saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Hippede hop hop hippede hop hop
Look at frosty go
Hippede hop hop hippede hop hop
Over the hills of snow
Hippede hop hop hippede hop hop
Look at frosty go
Hippede hop hop hippede hop hop
Over the hills of snow
