Get what you want
I feel so tired
Lucky pressure
See a little owe
What you can buy
Lucky pressure
I'll race with you
But I am tired
Lucky pressure
They were ahead
But they got lost
Lucky pressure

Give what you want
I feel so tired
Lucky pressure
See what you want
And you still want more
Lucky pressure
Play games with girls
Instead of fire
Lucky pressure
I choose life
Until expired
Lucky pressure

You're so lucky, stuck, and stupid
You're so lucky, stuck, and stupid

When it comes
Hard and fast
Lucky pressure
Spin it round
And make them last
Lucky pressure
Watch this space
I'm never still
Lucky pressure
Stop and stare
I never will
Lucky pressure

Get mixed up
But get inspired
Lucky pressure
They raced again
And began to tire
Lucky pressure
See the one
That you can buy
Lucky pressure
One by one
And side by side
