So, what's it all about?
I can't work you out
There's a chemistry between us, getting hard to disguise
Still you're holding back
Some kind of panic attack
Treading water when you really should be turning the tide

Don't spend a lifetime waiting
Don't tell me no, just let go

If you want it, then you've got it
Don't let this moment pass you by
Take a long shot, and give it all you got
You'll never know unless you try
You can only sink or swim
Baby, just dive in

So what's the worst thing
That could be happening?
You test the water, and you find that it's a little too hot
But I'm imagining
The taste of salt on your skin
Make your move, you've gotta choose, are you ready or not?

Don't waste a lifetime waiting
You know it's now, so turn around

If you want it, then you've got it
Don't let this moment pass you by
Take a long shot, and give it all you got
You'll never know unless you try
You can only sink or swim
Baby, just dive in

Just dive in, just dive in, let's dive in
Into the blue, into the deep, into the mood tonight, dive in

If you want it, then you've got it
Don't let this moment pass you by
Take a long shot, and give it all you got
You'll never know unless you try
You can only sink or swim
Baby, just dive in

Come with me, let's dive in.
