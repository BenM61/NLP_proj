Now the cry of the toucan for your man is history
Welcome to Heaven, the land of the rich and the free
The water's so clean you can fill your canteen with it cold
Please hand me your locket and I promise you pockets of gold
No soldiers to knock on your door
Now what can a man ask for more

Persona non grata!
Just lay your money down
Persona non grata!
On your knees and kiss the ground

I know all the right people we will make you legal in a flash
I won't take no for an answer no credit no checks just cash
Well it may seem like a lot but I'm really not in it for greed
As god as my witness I have a family and mistress to feed
What price can you put on a dream
Your fortune lies across the stream

Persona non grata!
Just lay your money down
Persona non grata!
On your knees and kiss the ground

Persona non grata!
Persona non grata!
No soldiers to knock on your door
Now what can a man ask for man

Persona non grata!
Just lay your money down
Persona non grata!
On your knees and kiss the ground

Persona non grata!
Persona non grata!
Lay your money down
Lay your money down
Persona non grata!
Persona non grata!
