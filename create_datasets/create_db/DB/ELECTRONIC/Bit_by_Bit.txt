Moving in, making my connection
Something's up, you can feel it in the air
Private eyes, never know who's watching
Playing cool, you haven't got a prayer

Have you heard the news making all the headlines
Zooming via satellite?
Have you heard the news coming through the grapevine
Fletch is working overtime

Bit by bit, one way or another
Bit by bit, running undercover
Tonight can't lose, making all the headlines

Bit by bit, gettin' to the bottom
Bit by bit, nothing's gonna stop us tonight

Diggin' in, gonna break by mornin'
Comin' out, you can read it in the Times

Have you heard the news making all the headlines
Zooming via satellite?
Have you heard the news coming through the grapevine
Fletch is working overtime

Bit by bit, one way or another
Bit by bit, running undercover
Tonight can't lose, making all the headlines

Bit by bit, gettin' to the bottom
Bit by bit, nothing's gonna stop us tonight
Tonight

Have you heard the news making all the headlines
Zooming via satellite?
Have you heard the news coming through the grapevine
Fletch is running outta time

Bit by bit, one way or another
Bit by bit, running undercover
Tonight can't lose, making all the headlines

Bit by bit, gettin' to the bottom
Bit by bit, nothing's gonna stop us tonight

Bit by bit, one way or another
Bit by bit, running undercover
Tonight can't lose, making all the headlines

Bit by bit, gettin' to the bottom
Bit by bit, nothing's gonna stop us tonight
