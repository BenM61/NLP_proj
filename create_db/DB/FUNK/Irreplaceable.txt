So, so irreplaceable
This love is so, so irreplaceable
(All I need)
So, so irreplaceable
My love is so, so irreplaceable
(All I need)

Everyday my joys are like a waterfall
Little things you do like a simple call
And my night is something like a miracle
Baby girl, you're feeling me too

Had a vision 'bout the river flowing me
In a clear blue sky
The way you found me
And wrapped around me
Angel you answered my cry
Wonderin' to through the search
Lonely think of it
Searchin' for the best
With the comfort of your ears

Girl this time there's no mistake
You got my heart banging
Like I lead a way
More than just sensational you are
Irreplaceable

Think I wanna make you mine
Take a vow and dedicate my love to you
You are so simply irreplaceable
Irreplaceable
Love you 'till the end of time
Promise I'll be spending all my life
Just making you happy
So irreplaceable you're all I need

So, so irreplaceable
This love is so, so irreplaceable
(All I need)

I can see the future as I fantasize
There's a baby boy with your pretty eyes
And the little girl who makes the world of you
Baby girl, you seeing it too
 
Had a vision 'bout the river flowing me
In a clear blue sky
Oh my, the way you found me
And wrapped around me
Angel you answered my cry

With a view form inside
Well it must in your eyes
God made you so beautiful
Wonderin' to the search
Lonely think of it
Searching for best
With the comfort and your ease

Girl this time there's no mistake
You got my heart banging
Like I lead a way
More than just sensational you are
Irreplaceable

Think I wanna make you mine
Take a vow and dedicate my love to you
You are so simply irreplaceable
Irreplaceable
Love you till the end of time
Promise I'll be spending all my life
Just making you happy
So irreplaceable you're all I need

All I ever wanted was a girl like you
So take this ring and say I do (I do)
Heaven must so blessed
It's 'cause of love so rare
It's beautiful, it's priceless, it's beyond compare.
