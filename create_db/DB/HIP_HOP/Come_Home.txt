Baby 
I've been thinking about our love 
And thought 
Maybe 
We could spend a little time  because 
Lately 
The moments that we share have been so 
Shaky 
You're still here  but you're not here 

Girl you're been away too long 
Won't you come home 
Come home 
I been missing you 
Since you been gone 
Won't you come home 
Come home 

You said 
That you need a change of pace, and so 
I said 
We both could use a little space 
Never thinking... 
A little while would be forever without your love 
Without your love 

I can't imagine life 
I can't imagine love 
If you're not here with me 
'Cause I can't get enough 
So when you change your mind 
My arms are open wide 
Do what you gotta do 
Just know I'm missing you 

Girl you're been away too long 
Won't you come home 
Come home 
I been missing you 
Since you been gone 
Won't you come home 
Come home 

Girl you're been away too long 
Won't you come home 
Come home 
I been missing you 
Since you been gone 
Won't you come home 
Come home 

I can't imagine life 
I can't imagine love 
If you're not here with me 
'Cause I can't get enough 
So when you change your mind 
My arms are open wide 
Do what you gotta do 
Just know I'm missing you 

Girl you're been away too long 
Won't you come home 
Come home 
I been missing you 
Since you been gone 
Won't you come home 
Come home
