One thing will lead to another
One touch and I'm closer to you
Oh, how I yearn to discover
All of the things I need to do
To live, to live to live all life of luxury
Holding you in my arms
Your heart, your heart, your heart
Your heart would belong to me
If I only knew where to start

One way to win your affection
One way to make that connection
I believe there's one way to your love
Love for life is my affliction
You are my sublime addiction
I believe there's one way to your love

Should I stand on a mountain
Should I dream of you here
Oh, it pours from me like a fountain
Still I can't have you near
To love, to love, to love, to love, to love you
Like a jewel in my arms
Your heart, your heart, your heart
Your heart would belong to me
If I only knew where to start

One way to win your affection
One way to make that connection
I believe there's one way to your love
Love for life is my affliction
You are my sublime addiction
I believe there's a way to your love

There's one way, one way to your love
There's one way, one way to your love
One way, one way, one way, one way to your love
One way, one way, one way, one way, one way to your love
One way, one way, one way to your love
There's one way, there's one way to your love
