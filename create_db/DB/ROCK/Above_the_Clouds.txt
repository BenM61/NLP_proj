Autumn blew its leaves at me,
Threatening winter as I walked
Summer always goes so quick, barely stopping like my thoughts
Which dip and spin and change so fast
I have to wonder, will I last

Through the windows of the train,
I caught reflections of a paper cup,
Hanging small in a pale blue sky,
Never knowing which way's up

Above the clouds, what's to be found,
I have to wonder, will I be around
As my anger shouts, at my own self doubt,
So a sadness creeps, into my dreams
When you're scared of living but afraid to die
I get scared of giving and I must find the faith to beat it

I must be me that's rushing by,
Time just lingers on the wind.
Bristlin' through my open fears,
I wonder what it's going to bring

Above the clouds, what's to be found,
I have to wonder, will I be around

Run and hide, run and hide
I catch the sail at evening's tide
