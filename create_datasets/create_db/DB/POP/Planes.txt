Oh Jesse I'd like to be
One of those men up on the screen
With an elegant lady and a cafe in Paris
Serving pernod and kahlua with cream

You can see it, I know
All the doors have been closed in my face
And the drinks at the Casbah
'Bout a mile or more from the place

And oh Jesse won't you look at the planes, tell me
Oh Jesse is it true what they say
There's a capital 'G' in the name of the game
The runway's the home of my silver grey plane
Oh won't you look at the planes
Riding down the skyway
Jesse aren't those wings just fine
Don't it make you wanna fly
Someday

Why friend am I so still
Tied to my job with time to kill
Do I still bear the traces of my old Don Quixote
Tilting giants on imaginary hills

And oh Jesse won't you look at the planes, tell me
Oh Jesse is it true what they say
There's a capitol 'G' in the name of the game
The runway's the home of my silver grey plane
Oh won't you look at the planes
Riding down the skyway
Jesse aren't those wings just fine
Don't it make you wanna fly
Someday

Oh won't you look at the planes
Riding down the skyway
Jesse aren't those wings just fine
Don't it make you wanna fly
Someday
