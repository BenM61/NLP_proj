In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between

Life is like a desert
An a oasis to confuse me
So I walk this razors edge
Will I stand or will I fall?

Turn a blind eye, try to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay or running away from all this madness

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me

Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me

All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You could thread a needle with a teardrop from my eyes
It's a cruel injustice to be witness to the things I see
Looking for the answer when it's right in front of me
From the Tower of Babylon where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me

Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me
