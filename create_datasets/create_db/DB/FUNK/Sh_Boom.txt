Life could be a dream
Life could be a dream, sh-boom

Life could be a dream, sh-boom
If I could take you up in paradise up above, sh-boom
If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream sweetheart

Hello hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again, boom

Oh, life could be a dream, sh-boom
If only all my precious plans would come true, sh-boom
If you would let me spend my whole life lovin' you
Life could be a dream sweetheart, sh-boom

Every time I look at you
Something is on my mind
If you do what I want you to
Baby, we'd be so fine

Oh, life could be a dream, sh-boom
If I could take you up in paradise up above, sh-boom
If you'd tell me, darlin', I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream sweetheart

Hello hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again, boom
