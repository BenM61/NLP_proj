Cross my heart that I love her
Place no one up above her

Ooh, ooh

I want a girl that's true
(I want a girl that's true)
To tell all my troubles to
(Tell all my troubles to)

Lord, why don't you
Send her right to me
Great God almighty, child
I said it right now

This fat boy's gonna love her
Place no one up above her
Don't you know I said
Ooh, ooh, ooh

On my knees every day
(On my knees every day)
To have none above, I pray
(Have none above, I pray)

I said, Lord
Send her right to me

Every day of my life
(Every day of my life)
I want her to be my wife
(Want her to be my wife)

Oh, Lord, hear me
Lord, please
Send her right to me

Cross my heart that I love her
Place no one up above her

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't you know
Baby, little girl, I said
I cross my heart to you

Don't you know, my darling
Don't you know myself
How much, how much
I'm really in love with you

Don't you know I said
We'll never part
Please don't ever
Break up my heart
