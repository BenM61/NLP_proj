To all the ladies in the dance
I lose all control when I see you
Standing there in front of me
Your style, your clothes, your hair
You fair woman, you look so sexy
De way you wine and, de way you dance
And de way that you twist and turn your waist
Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning
Leaves me feelin' for a taste

[Chorus]
Before the end of the night
I want to hold you so tight
You know I want you so much
And I'm so tempted to touch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch

To all the ladies in the dance
I don't even know your name
Little woman I don't even know your age
But there's something about you girl
When I see you wining in front the stage
Please forgive me, please excuse me
But there's nothing else that a man can do
I cannot pass or think a woman 
I just need to be next to you 

[Chorus] 

I want to feel you, I want to squeeze you
I want to hug and kiss and caress you 
I want to love you, I want to touch you
I'll place no one else above you
I want to feel you, I want to squeeze you
I want to touch and kiss and caress you
I want to love you, I want to hug you
You know woman I want to wings of a dove you 

[Chorus] 

To all the ladies in the dance
I lose all control when I see you
Standing there in front of me
Your style, your clothes, your hair
You fair woman, you look so sexy
De way you wine and, de way you dance
And de way that you twist and turn your waist
Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning
Leaves me feelin' for a taste

[Chorus]
