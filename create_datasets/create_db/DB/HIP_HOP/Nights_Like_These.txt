All our lives we're dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
For nights like these!
All our lives we're waiting, waiting, waiting
For nights like these!

Turn the lights down low
I don't wanna see the crowd cause I know
I made a bunch of calls tonight
To everyone I know, but no one could go.

What you think it's gonna happen?
Straight in the island of Manhattan
Couple struggling, standing there, clapping
Like who the hell is this rapping?

Fast forward years later
Jump right in without a life savior
Mind the details and... major
And I don't know what's next, but my mind seems made up

See what happens now
Is anyone care, so I'm asking around
And I'm starting from my... and I'm crashing down
And I'm on my own this time around

All our lives we're dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Oh for nights like these!
All our lives we're waiting, waiting, waiting
For nights like these!

Turn our radio loud
I close my eyes now, I see the whole crowd
Open out and start looking now
Like damn, this is weird, what a hell I do know?

A long ways for the long days
Trained to the city, walk a long pro way
Back down a long hallway
Hum for myself another song like always!

Just a care from the... that got lost in
The lights in town just blurred
That's why I keep going and the fire still burning
I found something... now I move forward

See what happens now
Does anyone care, so I ask around
I'm starting from my... I'm crashing down
I'm on my own, I crash around!

All our lives we're dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
For nights like these!
All our lives we're waiting, waiting, waiting
For nights like these!
Oh, oh, oh, oh

For nights like these!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
For nights like these!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
