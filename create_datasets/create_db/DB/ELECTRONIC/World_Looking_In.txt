Angels
Smilin' on my happiness
Danger
'Cause the scene is still a mess
( We can all be blessed )

Don't stop just yet
We' ve got the world looking in
Our window

Don't stop just yet
We' ve got the world looking in
Our window

Spacecraft
Spinning slowly out of sight
Peace man
Keep on chasing the wrong guy
( We'll see eye to eye )

Don't stop just yet
We' ve got the world looking in
Our window

Don't stop just yet
We' ve got the world looking in
Our window

We' ve got the world looking in
Our window
We' ve got the world looking in
Our window

Don't stop just yet
We' ve got the world looking in
Our window

Don't stop just yet
We' ve got the world looking in
Our window
