It's 2:30 in the morning
'Round this time you know we going in, yeah
I have the key so you don't throw it in, no
But you get crazy when you're horny

I feel like I should be your lover, I should be your friend
All those silly issues made up in your head
Money can pay for your time but it's not love
And love cannot pay for that shit that I bought ya
Swear to god I should be gone and leave you alone cause I

Rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
I'd rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bull
You (Yeah babe) 
You (Ooh Ooh yeah)
You, yeah

This is what I don't get
Don't know why I'm still here
All my passwords reset, yeah
And I know you did that shit

'Cause money can pay for your time but it ain't love
And love cannot pay for that shit that I bought you
Ooh, got me up on some drama
Knowing this shit is a problem yeah
Swear to god I should be gone and leave you alone but I

Rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
I'd rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bull
You (Yeah babe) 
You (Ooh Ooh yeah)
You, yeah

Know you got problems
You got a lot of problems
Know damn well I can solve 'em
You got a lot of problems
Know you got problems

I should be your lover, I should be your friend
All those silly issues made up in your head
Money can pay for your time but it's not love
And calling me back with some bullshit like what up
Swear to god I should be gone and leave you alone but I

Rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
