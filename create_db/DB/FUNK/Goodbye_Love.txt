It's true you sold your guitar and bought a car?
It's true, I'm leaving now for Santa Fe
It's true, you're with this yuppie scum?
You said you'd never speak to him again

Not now
Who said that you have any say in who she says things to at all?
Yeah
Who said that you should stick your nose in other people's
Who said I was talking to you?
We used to have this fight each night (calm down)
She'd never admit I existed (everyone please)

He was the same way
He was always, run away, hit the road, don't commit
You're full of shit

She's in denial (He's in denial)
Don't give an inch
When I gave a mile (come on)
I gave a mile
Gave a mile to who?
Come on guys, chill

I'd be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had
Someone to live for, unafraid to say I love you
All your words are nice, Mimi
But love's not a three way street
You'll never share real love
Until you love yourself, I should know
You all said you'd be cool today
So please, for my sake

I can't believe he's gone
I can't believe you're going
I can't believe this family must die
Angel helped us believe in love
I can't believe you disagree
I can't believe this is goodbye

I hear there are great restaurants out west
Some of the best, how could she?
How could you let her go?
You just don't know
How could we lose Angel?
Maybe you'll see why when you stop escaping your pain

At least now if you try, Angel's death won't be in vain
His death is in vain
Are you insane?
There's so much to care about

There's me, there's Mimi
Mimi's got her baggage too
So do you
Who are you to tell me what I know
What to do
A friend

But who, Mark, are you?
Mark has got his work
They say, "Mark lives for his work"
And, "Mark's in love with his work"
Mark hides in his work

But from what?
From facing your failure
Facing your loneliness
Facing the fact that you live a lie

Yes, you live a lie, tell you why
You're always preaching not to be numb
When that's how you thrive
You pretend to create and observe
When you really detach from feeling alive
Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive
Poor baby

Mimi still loves you
Are you really jealous
Or afraid that Mimi's weak?
Mimi did look pale
Mimi's gotten thin
Mimi's running out of time

And you're running out the door
No more, I've gotta go
Hey, for somebody who's always been let down who's heading out of town?
For someone who longs for a community of his own
Who's with his camera, alone?
I'll call, I hate the fall
You heard?
Every word

You don't want baggage without lifetime guarantees
You don't want to watch me die?
I just came to say goodbye love
Goodbye love

Came to say goodbye love, goodbye
Just came to say goodbye love (glory) 
Goodbye love (one blaze of)
Goodbye love
I have to find

Please don't touch me, understand
I'm scared, I need to go away
I know a place, a clinic
A rehab?
Maybe, could you?
I'll pay
Goodbye love
Goodbye love

Came to say goodbye love, goodbye
Just came to say goodbye love
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
