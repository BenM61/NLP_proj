The rain fell soft on the green and distant fields.
I saw you run to the shelter of the trees.
I stood alone with weeds and broken brick.
My pale fingers curled around blades of autumn grass.

I heard your feet crack earth and branch, but you were covered by the rain.
I shouted out and called your name, but you were hiding in the trees.
Days in the trees.

You rubbed the sleep from my tired eyes,
And let the real taste of God
Change the color of my thoughts.

I was draining the heaven
From the warmth of your breast,
Lighting fire on the stone.

I tore at the seams of my smooth and laundered clothes,
And ran to the trees, racing naked against the day.

I heard your feet crack earth and branch, but you were covered by the rain.
I shouted out and called your name, but you were hiding in the trees.
Days in the trees.

The ascent to your heaven,
Spending days in the trees.
I can't stand them laughing at us.
