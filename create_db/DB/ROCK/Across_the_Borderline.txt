There's a place where I've been told every street is
Paved with gold
And it's just across the borderline
When it's time to take your turn here's a lesson
That you must learn
You could lose more than you'll ever find
When you reach the broken promiseland every dream
Slips through your hand
You'll know it's too late
To change your mind
'Cause you paid the price to come so far
Just to wind up where you are
And you're still just
Across the borderline
Up and down the Rio Grande a
Thousand footprints in the sand
Reveal the secret no one can define
The river flows on like a breath in between our
Life and death
Who's the next to cross the borderline
Hope remains when pride is gone
And it keeps you moving on
Calling you across the borderline
When you reach the broken promiseland
And you're still just across the borderline
