Been enough heartaches in my life
I've been down some dark lonely roads
You've rescued a soul, well, worth saving
Look what you've done

And now I'm mad over you
I'm mad over you
I'm mad over you
You've made all my dreams come true

Now I've got hopes for tomorrow
And I've got more patience than time
A better understanding of life's unspoken side
Look what you've done

And now I'm mad over you
I'm mad over you
I'm mad, mad over you
You've made all my dreams come true

If you ever need me and understanding too
I'll come running
(I'll come running)

Because I'm mad, mad over you
I'm mad over you
I'm mad, mad over you
You've made all my dreams
(Made all my dreams)
You've made all my dreams come true

Now I've been known as a dreamer
And I'm proud that most have come true
But if all else fails in these times of change
I'll forever be, I'll forever be

I'll be mad over you
Mad over you
Mad, mad over you
You've made all my dreams
You've made all my dreams come true
