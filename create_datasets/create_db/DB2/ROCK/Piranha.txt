Keep thoughts high in the sky 
You're like a big kite 
That's flying from people 
Who want to keep you down  
Down in the crowds 
Where they're always breakin' out 
Watch out for piranhas 
There's always piranhas 
Watch out for piranhas 

Ready or not 
Like it or not 
Here they come again 
It's a shame 
But you are just laughing 
People want to keep you in the dark 
You're always a mess 
But you're always a step ahead of the crowd 

Watch out for piranhas 
There's always piranhas 
Watch out for piranhas 
So many times I have been late 
While feeling the breeze 
Tons of hopeless thoughts in me 
Now I'm free
And now I'm free! 

Watch out for piranhas 
You can be what you want 
It's a matter of time 
Prepare to be amazed 
You're flashing 
They're frowning 
You flash the clover leaf cheer 
It's a game 
You're winning 
There's always so many piranhas 

Watch out for piranhas 
There's always piranhas 
Watch out for piranhas
