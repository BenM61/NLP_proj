When I was coming down from someone else ya know
You took my hand
You pushed me up, you pulled me out
Ya done me good do ya understand?
No one else around could have saved me
Oh Jolie ya shone just like the sun
And like the dead you came and you raised me
Oh Jolie look at what you done... baby!!

You may be young but you got so much more
Than any girl I know
And I see your face most every place
Don't make no difference where I go

So lets not fall so fast that we get crazy
Oh Jolie will ya think of me?
And when your picture of me gets a little hazy
Ya know Jolie its only you I see, Jolie!

No one else around could have saved me
Oh Jolie ya shone just like the sun
And like the dead you came and you raised me
Oh Jolie look at what you done
Look at what you done

Baby!
Jolie, I love you
