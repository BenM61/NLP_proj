When you were young
Did you ever love somebody
Like I love,
I love you now
'Cause now that you're older
I see you don't mind
Letting go of my hand in a crowd
You don't want to hold tight.
And when we kiss goodnight
There's a million hearts
Beating in my room
I wish they would go away.
Ah say it again
There's a million hearts
That break too soon
Everytime you go away.

When you were young
Did you ever fall down,
Graze your knee
And want to run to someone
'Cause now that you're older
I've been falling down,
I want to run to someone
But there's nobody around.

I can hear the sound
There's a million hearths
Beating in my room
I wish they would go away,
Ah say it again
There's a million hearts
That break too soon
Every time you go away.

Every time you go away
Think about the things I say
Think about it twice as long
Tell me what's going wrong.
