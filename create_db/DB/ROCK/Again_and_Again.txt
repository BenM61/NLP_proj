Mama save me, save me
Mama bless me to my bones
You have started the fire
Ooh reignite my soul
With your poison sting
This is deep and true
I'll do anything
Your sweet perfume you bleed
Till the well is overflown
You're my gold, my hunger
Where you go, I will follow
Sweet poison sting
I see the light
I see everything in you tonight
I breath

In and out here we go oh oh
Over and again and again
Oh and the love you give to me
Here mama I'ma give it back to you

All the stars in the sky so beautiful
In your eyes shine, shine
Reaching out, reaching out for you
Just to kiss your mouth
Wanna turn you inside out
Isn't it such a thing
As you do to me
Sweet poison sting
Let's me see
I'll be your king 'cause you are my queen

In and out here we go oh oh
Over and again and again
All the love you give to me
Mama I'ma give it back to you

Oh don't let it get away
If we did, we gonna get it back
All in time you and me
We will, we will, we will, we will be

Over and again and again
Oh and the love you give to me
Mama I'ma give it back to you

Turn around here we go oh oh
Over and again and again
All of the love, you give to me
Mama I'ma give it back to you

Oh and the love
That you ever had I give it back to you
Again
Mama I'ma give it back to you
