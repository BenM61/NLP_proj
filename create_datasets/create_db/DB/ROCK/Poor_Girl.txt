This is a story 'bout a poor girl, a story that you ought to know 
She lived all alone in a one room flat on a street where the lights are low 
Every night about the same time she'd go and put her glad rags on 
Go to the place where everyone goes to Boogaloo all night long 

She's a poor girl 
Born and raised in the country she got tired of pushing a plow 
She take my train to the city and mother you should look at her now 
With her rattlesnake boots, elephant bag, genuine crocodile hat 
Around her neck to top it off she even wears a persian cat 

She's a poor girl 
That was the story of the poor girl but now she uses her head 
She's back home working on the land instead of playing in bed 
The fast life she was living took her as it's prey 
Now she's back in the country getting fatter every day 

She's a Poor Girl
