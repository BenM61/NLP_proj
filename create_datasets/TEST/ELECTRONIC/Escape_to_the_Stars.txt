I'm sick and tired of this so-called life
Without room to breathe
I toss and turn in my bed all night
Am I the only one who finds no peace?

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Escape to the stars
Feeling so free
Just you and me
Escape to the stars
Chasing a dream
All that we need is to believe
Escape to the stars

I've always been the one to speak my mind
Strove against the stream
Take on the system or leave it behind
And you will find a new reality

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Escape to the stars
Feeling so free
Just you and me
Escape to the stars
Chasing a dream
All that we need is to believe
Escape to the stars

Overcome gravity
Holding you down
On the ground
Free from insanity
No one else is around
