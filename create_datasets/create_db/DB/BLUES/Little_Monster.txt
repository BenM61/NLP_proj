Hey little monster, I got my eye on you
Where are you going, where you running to?
Hey little monster, you know it's all okay
I'm gonna love ya, no matter what you say

I've got love on my fingers
Lust on my tongue
You say you got nothing,
So come out and get some
Heartache to Heartache,
I'm your wolf, I'm your man
I say run little monster,
Before you know who I am

Hey little creature,
Tell me what's on your mind,
Where've you been hiding?
And can I come this time?
So pleased to please ya
And rip that heart off your sleeve,
What we discover

I've got love on my fingers
Lust on my tongue
You say you got nothing,
So come out and get some
Heartache to Heartache,
I'm your wolf, I'm your man
I say run little monster
Before you know who I am

I've got love on my fingers
Lust on my tongue
You say you got nothing,
So come out and get some
Heartache to Heartache
I'm your wolf, I'm your man
I say run little monster,
Before you know who I

Am
