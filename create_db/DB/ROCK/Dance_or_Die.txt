Transmission radio, radio, respond if you're alive
Give me a sign of life
I need to say to you, say to you,
I've found a way to fight
One hope for all mankind

We're gonna take control
Dancing is your weapon
Let your moves unfold
Kill 'em with your steppin'

We can win this war
It's time to come together
Now we're stronger than we were before

They're trying to take our lives
But we will survive
We're running out of time, the world ends tonight
Unless we dance or die, dance or die
Dance or die, dance or die
Dance or die, dance or die

Transmission radio, radio, take back the night
Dance for your right
I'm on my way to you, way to you, we can reunite
And watch the sky ignite

They couldn't take the sound
They fall harder when they're bigger
Yeah they all crashed down
Our party pulled the trigger

We won this war
Because we came together
Made 'em wish that they were never born

They try to take your lives
But you will survive
Look into my eyes, don't say goodbye
Unless we dance or die, dance or die
Dance or die, dance or die
Dance or die, dance or die

One-two-three-four
I declare a dance war
Dance or die

Yeah it's five-six-seven-eight
Now we're gonna celebrate
Dance or die

One-two-three-four
I declare a dance war
Dance or die

Yeah it's five-six-seven-eight
Now we're gonna celebrate
Dance or die

They try to take your lives
But you will survive
Look into my eyes, don't say goodbye
Gota dance or die, dance or die
Dance or die, dance or die
One-two-three-four
I declare a dance war
Dance or die
Yeah it's five-six-seven-eight
Now we're gonna celebrate
Dance or die
