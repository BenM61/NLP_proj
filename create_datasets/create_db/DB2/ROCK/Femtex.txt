Masturbation saved my life
I was nervous as a child
You were someone out of my hands
Couldn't understand or have

She's not trying to catch your eye
She's just trying to get a life
He feels weak when she is strong
Feeling threatened when he's wrong

Do you want a f*ck?
Do you want a friend?
Do you want sex?
Do you want revenge?

You never make love
With a smile on your face
Punished with love
And rewarded with hate

(I'm just with you)
That will never mean that I'm just for you
(I'm just with you)
That will never mean that I'm just for you
(I'm just with you)
That will never mean that I'm just for you
(I'm just with you)
