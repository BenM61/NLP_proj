One two three four
(Love-Love-Love-Love)
You, you were on a moon- MOON-BEAM
Me, I was on a star
Gee everything was blue, BLUE-GREEN
Be cause everything was far
Me, I was in a mo- MO-VIE
You, you were in a song
Gee everything was groo, GRO-OVY
We everything was wrong
And no matter where you are
I can always see that far
You were on a MO-ON-BEAM of love
A pretty little moonbeam
It's you I'm thinking of
HEY! I was only trying to say
You're a million miles away
I can feel you dancin' anyway
You, you were on a moonbeam
And me I was in a cloud
And everything was Lou Reed
And everything was loud
No matter where you were
Well I could always see that fer
You were on a MO-ON-BEAM of love
A pretty little moonbeam
Moonbeam of love
A pretty little moonbeam
Shining from above
A pretty little moonbeam
It's you I'm thinking of
A pretty little moonbeam
Do you dream of LOVE
