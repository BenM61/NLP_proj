Don't judge by what you see
There's a softer part of me
Girl, my life has been so cold
There were times I needed you so

Do you remember me? I was the one
(I was the one)
I was the one who loved you long ago
Do you remember me?
From the days when our hearts were young
Do you remember me?

Look deep into my eyes
There's a glow you'll recognize
Girl, I can't change all the wrong that I've done
Time can't erase the love that we knew

Girl, do you remember me? I was the one
(I was the one)
I was the one who loved you long ago
Do you remember me?
From the days when our hearts were young

Do you remember me?
I'm not a stranger, girl
More than just a member
Do you remember me?

Girl

I was the one who was wrong no doubt about it
I was the one who broke all our dreams in two
I was the one who could never forget about you

Do you remember me, girl?
Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?

Girl, do you remember me? I was the one
(I was the one)
I was the one who loved you long ago
Do you remember me?
From the days when our hearts were young

Girl, do you remember me?
I'm not a stranger, girl
More than just a memory
Do you remember me?
From the days when our hearts were young
(When our hearts were young)

Girl, do you remember me?
(Remember me)
I do remember you
(Remember you)
Say you remember me
(Say you remember me)

I not a memory
(I not a memory)
Do you remember me?
From the days when our hearts were young

Do you remember me?
From the days when our hearts were young
Girl, do you remember me? I was the one
(I was the one)
I was the one who loved you long ago
