All that I have I'd gladly give to you 
Deep in my heart i feel secure, 
I want you to know that i am here for you, 
Cause i know in my heart you belong here, 
And i never knew love like this. 
When you hold me, and you thrill me, 
And i never knew love like this. 
When you touch me, and you leave me breathless, 
When You
You hold me in your arms 

I still remember when you came to me 
You were so very insecure 
Think through I'm someone's insincerity 
And i know in my heart you belong here 
And i never knew love like this 
When you hold me, and you thrill me, 
And i never knew love like this 
When you touch me and you leave me breathless, 
I never knew love like this 
When you hold me, and you thrill me, 
And i never knew love like this 
When you touch me and you leave me breathless, 
When You... You hold me in your arms

And i never knew love like this 
When you hold me, and you thrill me, 
And i never knew love like this 
When you touch me and you leave me breathless, 
I never knew love like this 
When you hold me, and you thrill me, 
And i never knew love like this 
When you touch me and you leave me breathless, 
I never knew love like this
