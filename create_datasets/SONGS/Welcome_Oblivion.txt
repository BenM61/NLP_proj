I don't know if you can hear me over this
I don't know if you can hear the sound
I don't know if you're aware of what's happening
I don't know if you should stick around

It's so perfect with a perfect kiss from your lips
It's so perfect with a loving embrace
You can't f*ck with the way of nature
Everything is falling into place

You know what you have done
Welcome oblivion
And this has just begun
Welcome oblivion

All the flashing lights take over
All the pretty little dots make tracks
Leading you to your place of deliverance
And never look at what's behind the fear

You know what you have done
Welcome oblivion
And this has just begun
Welcome oblivion

And I am not afraid
And I am not afraid
And I am not afraid
And I am not afraid
