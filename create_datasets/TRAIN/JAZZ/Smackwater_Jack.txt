Now, Smackwater Jack,
He bought a shotgun
'Cause he was in the mood
For a little confrontation.
He just a-let it all hang loose;
He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.

You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.

Now, Big Jim the chief
Stood for law and order.
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border.
Now, from his bulldog mouth,
As he led the posse south,
Came the cry, "We got to ride
To clean up the streets
For our wives and our daughters!"

You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
No, no, no, no, no.

The account of the capture
Wasn't in the papers,
But you know, they hanged ol' Smack right then
Instead of later.
You know, the people were quite pleased
'Cause the outlaw had been seized
And on the whole, it was a very good year
For the undertaker.

You know, you know, you can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.
A shotgun in his hand.
Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun.
Yeah, Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun.
Oh, Smackwater Jack, yeah.
Talkin' 'bout Smackwater Jack, yeah.
Talkin' 'bout a-Smackwater Jack, now.
Talkin' 'bout Smack.
