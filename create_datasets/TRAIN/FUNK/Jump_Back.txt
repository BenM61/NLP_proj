Last night, night before (jump back baby jump back)
24 robbers at my door. (jump back baby jump back)

I got up and let 'em in (jump back baby jump back)
Hit 'em in the head with a rolling pin. (jump back baby jump back)

When I got 'em in a billy goat town (jump back baby jump back)
Billy goat kicked his pappy down (jump back baby jump back)
(Oh jump back baby jump back)
(Oh jump back baby jump back)
(Oh jump, jump)

Now I lay me down to sleep (jump back baby jump back)
giving the bed bugs a chance to creep (jump back baby jump back)
If one should bite before I wake (jump back baby jump back)
Hope the world his jaw will break (jump back baby jump back)
(Oh jump back baby jump back)
(Oh jump back baby jump back)
(Oh jump, jump)

Went to the river, I couldn't get across
Paid five dollars for an old gray hoss
Hoss wouldn't pull, I swapped him for a bull
Bull wouldn't holla, I sold him for a dollar
Dollar wouldn't pass, I throwed it in the grass
Grass wouldn't grow, I chopped it wid a hoe
Hoe wouldn't chop, I took it to the shop
Shop made money like a bee makes honey.
