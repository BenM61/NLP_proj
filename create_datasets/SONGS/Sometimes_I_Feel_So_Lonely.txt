You can be redeemed, boys, you can be redeemed
Life is but a dream, boy, you can be redeemed
Nothing's as it seems, you can be redeemed

Everything's permitted, nothing's really true
Live outside the law, boys, doing what to do
Nothing's at it seems, you can be redeemed

Sometimes I feel so lonely
Sometimes I feel so lonely
Sometimes I feel so lonely
Sometimes I feel so lonely

You can be redeemed, boys, you can be redeemed
Life is but a dream, boy, you can be redeemed
Nothing's as it seems, you can be redeemed

Sometimes I feel so lonely
Sometimes I feel so lonely
Sometimes I feel so lonely
