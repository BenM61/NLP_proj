Little lady, ring him lately
What ya want?
“Well, what ya know?”
Gimme teeth, my gut is cheap
My heart will choke and overflow

Snake in the pouring rain
Dust in the Chevrolet
Lust is boring, old men choring
Holy rollers on a hearse (You got, you got, holy water)
Shake like a gamma ray, Mississippi, Alabama state
Trust I must to quake through the crust that your Bible swinging dicks reverse
Inspecting every flight delay, bombing down the motorway
Your stripes and stars can lay pipe on Mars
'Cause sitting pretty pays slow
Infect me with your hate
Beg for heaven’s gate
Tell God my city is starting to sink and it’s starting to stink so let it go

Little lady, ring him lately
What ya want?
“Well, what ya know?”
Gimme teeth, my gut is cheap
My heart will choke and overflow

Who make you look, who make you talk?
Who put your love in the gutter?
I mix you up, I let you off, I’ll make your heart stutter
Nobody let you leave 'em alone
Ain’t nobody know the love from the throne
Holy, holy, holy water
And you can, and you can, you can rock
Holy, holy, holy water
Rings getting pried off
Kings gonna die off

Ha, blame your own
Ha, blame your idols
Ha, watch it fall, watch it fall
Watch it crumble

Gather all the energy and take it for yourselves and never sweeten up the water
Flexing every ounce of muscle holding up the ceiling with the pillars of destruction

Ha, blame your own
Ha, blame your idols
Ha, watch it fall, watch it fall
Watch it crumble

Don't cross the river with an alligator underneath your knees
The golden promise of desire resting underneath the seas

Ha, blame your own
Ha, blame your idols
Ha, watch it fall, watch it fall
Watch it crumble

Who make you look, who make you talk?
Who put your love in the gutter?
I mix you up, I let you off, I’ll make your heart stutter
Nobody let you leave 'em alone
Ain’t nobody know the love from the throne
Holy, holy, holy water
You can, and you can, you can rock
Holy, holy, holy water
Rings getting pried off
Kings gonna die off

Shake like a gamma ray

Little lady, ring him lately
What ya want?
“Well, what ya know?”
Gimme teeth, my gut is cheap
My heart will choke and overflow (Choke and overflow)

Aquaria
Aquaria
Rings getting pried off
Kings finna, kings finnaa, kings finna die off
