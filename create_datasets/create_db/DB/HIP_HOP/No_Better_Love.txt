For the ladies, OK girl
I want to be your mother, ya father, brother, 
Your sister your everything, you know?
Uh, goin' straight to the top baby

I think I might wife her
You know, powder blue Roc-A-Wear suit, white Nike
My niggas like her
She been with me through the grind
Girl you put in that top like been lifers
You got tight used to hooky and chill
So I tight plus she cook up a meal
Had the hook up for real
More headaches and stress cause a child involved
It's all good cause our sex be my Tylenol
Best baby dollar fall
Shit the rest of you childish broads
Give me the sex then I'm tired of y'all
So find a next to provide for y'all
I got my baby girl, plus she about to drop, 
My baby girl
Forget about all the rumors you hear girl
I know a life soon to be here girl
And can't nothin' f*ck up that
Got to f*ck with that
Can't find a better love than that, 
My baby girl

[Chorus]
Don't stop givin' me your lovin'
Cause my heart's been racin' for your lovin'
And I won't give it up for nothin'
'Cause there's no better love
Girl you got me goin' crazy
You got me thinkin' 'bout you baby
Could you be my one and only lady
'Cause there's no better love

Comin' up I thought Cupid was stupid
Only two loves my family and music
Fallin' through somethin' just couldn't do it
It was the beginning of time, 
And you was like nine
But God damn you was fine
Used to stay on my mind, 
When I was out on my grind
Opened up the bags when I'm choppin' my dimes
They ? spittle stood by me for the rentals
Popped up last year with me and got me rentals
Sick with the plastic, what can I say
Bitches hate around the way, I had a lay day
Gossip and watchin' him, runnin' back
Moved up North, kinda fell off track
Still my peoples though, 
Love when I see you though
Once a while might call just to chill might ball
Forever my dog, even when I downfall
First in line whenever chick is involved, what

[Chorus]

We the youngest in charge, so lead 'em of his ?
We give you better love the same time is tough
Baby I feel the same as Neef do
Spit the game as he do
If you could take two, 
Ain't no need to bring your people
Lingerie see-through
She got it goin' on
Oh that's can't stop, won't stop
We got 'em goin' home
We got 'em all alone
Just us nobody's wrong
I'ma hit her, you can hit her
We waffle house in the morn'

Ever since the day I saw your face
My mind told me you were the one that was down for me
And baby when I get laced, 
I'm gonna do what you want I'll be there (truly)
So don't you let a thing, 
Turn you away from the love that you need (my dear)
I don't want to play around wit ya 
'Cause I know I found lovin' (right here)

[Chorus: x2]
