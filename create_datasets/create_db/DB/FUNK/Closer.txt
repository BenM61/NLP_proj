Closer to my dreams
It's coming over me

I'm getting higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm getting higher, and higher
Feel it in my sleep
Sometimes it feels like I'll never go pass here
Sometimes it feel like I'm stock forever, ever

But I'm going higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm Going higher and higher
I can almost reach

Sometimes you just have to let it go
Leaving all my fears to burn and die
Push the all away so I can move on
Closer to my dreams

Feel it all over my being
In my being
Close your eyes and seek what you believe

I'm moving higher
I'm going higher and higher
Closer to my dreams
Higher and higher

I'm moving upward and onward and beyond all that I could see
Stretching out my arms so I can reach
I'm so close
It's like I can just reach

I can feel my dreams
Closer to my dreams
I'm moving closer to my dreams
Sometimes it feel like you'll never grow and change
But you never choose to walk away
