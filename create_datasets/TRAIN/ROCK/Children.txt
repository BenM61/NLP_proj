Wait for me my only son
I can't see you from above
I'm so proud of what you've done
Wait for me my only son

Children breathe
Children bleed
I can't see you and me

Wait for me before you die
I can see love in your eyes
As you watch me walk away
I can see a mother's pain

Children breathe
Children bleed
I can't see you and me

Now you're gone and all that's left
A piece of you I can't forget
Soft and sweet little voice
Can't ? we've got no choice

Children breathe
Children bleed
I can't see you and me
