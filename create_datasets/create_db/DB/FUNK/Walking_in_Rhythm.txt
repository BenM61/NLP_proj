Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Trying to move on
I'm walking in rhythm
Singing my song
Thinking about my baby
Trying to get home

Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Trying to move on

It's been so long since I seen her
I'm tired and so all alone
I've traveled so very far
I've got to get back home
Got to get back home

It's been so long since I seen her
I'm tired and so all alone
I've traveled so very far
I've got to get back home
Got to get back home

Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Trying to move on
I'm walking in rhythm
Singing my song
Thinking about my baby
Trying to get home
