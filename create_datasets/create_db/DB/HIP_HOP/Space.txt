I never been one to hide my feelings
Baby, you blow my mind
I painted your face upon my ceiling
I stare at it all the time

I imagine myself inside your bedroom
Oh I imagine myself in your sky
(You) you are the reason there's bass in my boom
(Oh you) you are the reason I'm high

If you and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make you understand
That everything I want to do to your body, baby
I would do to your head 
Then you'd be hip to the deep rush
Deeper than the boom of the bass
With every other flick of the pink plush
The closer we get to the space (The closer we get to the space)

(The space)
(The space)
(The space)
Don't you want to go? (The space)
Where the souls go (The space)
Where the tears flow (The space)
Where the love grows
Do you want to go?

I never been one for this thing obsession
But just keep your eye on my hips
The circles they may be my confession
Just say the word and I'll strip

I've had dreams of us cuddling on the planet mars
Then when I wake up, I'm all covered in sex
With eyes that fall somewhere between rubies and stars
Don't look at me baby or I'll flex

If you and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make you understand
That everything I want to do to your body, baby
I would do to your head
Then you'd be hip to the deep rush
Deeper than the boom of the bass
With every other flick of the pink plush
The closer we get to the space 

(The space)
Go (The space)
Flow (The space)
Grow
Do you want to go?
(The space)
Where the souls go (The space)
Where the tears flow (The space)
Where the love grows
Do you want to go?
