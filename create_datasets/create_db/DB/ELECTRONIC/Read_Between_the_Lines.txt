You're not the first to be lonely
Thank God you're not the only
Relax with the fact you're surrounded
Follow your bloodline
We feel warm when we think we're protected
Cry out when we feel rejected
Maybe in some other life we're connected
We've seen it all before

Please take heart, find your soul
Read between the lines
Please take heart, play your role
Read between the lines

Please believe I implore you
Spirit flight will restore you
Only love can ignore you
Another fighting heart

Please take heart, find your soul
Read between the lines
Please take heart, play your role
Read between the lines
Please take heart
Read between the lines
Please take heart

Feel warm if you think that you know me
I thank God when you show me
Happy that we're just surviving
Please take heart, we'll survive

Please take heart, find your soul
Read between the lines
Please take heart, play your role
Read between the lines
Please take heart
Read between the lines
Please take heart

You're not the first to be lonely
Between the lines
Thank God you ain't the only
Between the lines
