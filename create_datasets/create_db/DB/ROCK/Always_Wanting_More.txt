Bleeding you dry
By leaving you high
They always want something more from you
Cutting your throat
Or telling a joke
It never seems clever to be

You could never see

Leaving your best
From the things that you miss
You always need something more from them
Telling you things
To kill all your dreams

It's your trip
It's not me

You could never see

Always wanting more
You're always wanting more
You're such a useless bore
But you're always wanting more

You could never see

Always wanting more
You're always wanting more
You're such a useless bore
But you're always wanting more
