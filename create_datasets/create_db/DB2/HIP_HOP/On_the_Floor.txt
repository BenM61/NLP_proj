I was blind, now I can see
You made a believer out of me
I was blind, now I can see
You made a believer out of me

I'm movin' on up now
Getting out of the darkness
My light shines on
My light shines on
My light shines on

I was lost
Now I'm found
I believe in you 
I got no bounds
I was lost
Now I'm found
I believe in you
I got no bounds 

I'm movin' on up now
Getting out of the darkness
My light shines on 
My light shines on 
My light shines on 

I'm gettin out of the darkness
My light shines on
I'm gettin out of the darkness my light shines on 
If you got it you can have it
You cana have it
If you got it
If you got it
You can have it
Gonna move it on up
