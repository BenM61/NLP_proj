In nineteen and fifty-nine we took a little hike
With our scout master down to Lake Oneeganite
We took a little pizza and we took some saurkrauts
And we marched along together till we heard the girl scouts

[Chorus:]
We're the boys from Camp Kookamonga
Our mothers sent us here for to study nature's ways
We learned to make sparks by rubbing sticks together
But if we catch the girls then we'll set the woods ablaze

And I was mad because me mother sent me up here ha-ha-ha

Well we crept up to the water and we see the girls a-swimming
There must've been a hundred of them pretty young women
They looked so fine even birds forgot to sing
We lay down in the poison oak and didn't say a thing

[Chorus]

Hey will one of you fellas scratch my back?

Well our counselor said we could take them by surprise
If we didn't say a word till we looked them in the eyes
We kept real still and we had our eyes aglued
We saw how they were dressed they were swimming in the
Well now...

[Chorus]

Well they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
They ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast even we couldn't catch them
And we can even hike all the way to Buffalo

Hey fellas wait for me

Well we ran right after them till everyone was pooped
So we rested for a moment and our forces we regrouped
Then we saw the girls behind some evergreens
Captured by a company of United States Marines

[Chorus]

Aww those big guys get everything

Well they ran through the briars an they ran through the brambles
They ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast even we couldn't catch them
And we can even hike all the way to Buffalo

[Chorus]

A-rootie-toot-toot a-rootie-toot-toot
Ah we are the boys from the boy scout troop
We don't smoke and we don't chew
And we don't go with the girls that do
