You are one of god's mistakes.
You crying, tragic waste of skin.
I'm well aware of how it aches.
And you still won't let me in.
Now I'm breaking down your door,
To try and save your swollen face.
Though I don't like you anymore
You lying, trying waste of space.

My oh my.
A song to say goodbye.
A song to say goodbye
A song to say goodbye,
A song to say,
Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those blessed with lucky sevens,
And the voice that made me cry.

You were Mother Nature's son.
Someone to whom I could relate.
Your needle and your damage done,
Remains a sordid twist of fate,
Now I'm trying to wake you up,
To pull you from the liquid sky.
Cause if I don't we'll both end up with just your songs that say goodbye.

My oh my.
A song to say goodbye,
A song to say goodbye,
A song to say,
Before our innocence was lost you were always one of those blessed with lucky sevens,
And a voice that made me cry.
It's a song to say goodbye
