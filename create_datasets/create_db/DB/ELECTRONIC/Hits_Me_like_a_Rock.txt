IT'S BEEN SO LONG I HEARD THAT SONG
IT MADE ME SWEAT WHEN I SANG ALONG
AND EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME THAT WENT PAST BY
IT HITS ME LIKE A ROCK AND 
I STILL DON'T KNOE WHY...
TAKE ME ON YOUR MOTORCYCLE...
RUN WITH YOU THRU THE HILLS...
WE DON'T CARE FOR WHAT'S WRONG AND WHAT'S NOT
I LIKE TO BE WITH YOU 
WITHOUT A FEEL OF WHAT'S REAL
BUT THEN YOU SAY WE ALWAYS LOOSE OUR EDGE
BUT BABY, BABY...IS THAT TOO BAD?
YOU KNOW I LIKE YOU A LOT BUT...
IT STILL HITS ME LIKE A ROCK.
YOU TOLD ME IF WE EVER COLLIDE AGAIN
YOU WOULD MELT MY BRAIN A MILLION TIMES
AND HAVE TOO MANY BRUISES FROM TOO MUCH KISSING
AND THE ONLY PAIN WOULD BE 
FROM TOO MUCH MISSING.
BUT THEN YOU SAY WE ALWAYS LOSE OUR EDGE
BUT BABY, BABY IS THAT TOO BAD?
YOU KNOW I LIKE YOU A LOT BUT...
IT STILL HITS ME LIKE A ROCK...OO-OOH-OOOOOOH
IT STILL HITS ME LIKE A ROCK...OO-OOH-OOOOOOH!
IT STILL HITS ME LIKE A ROCK...OO-OOH-OOOOOOH!
IT'S BEEN SO LONG I HEARD THAT SONG
IT MADE SWEAT ALL NIGHT LONG...STILL AFTER
ALL THIES TIME IT HITS ME LIKE A ROCK
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY...THEN YOU SAY
WE ALWAYS LOOSE OUR EDEGE, BUT BABY-BABY IS
TAHT TOO BAD? YOU KNOW I LIKE YOU A LOT,
BUT...
