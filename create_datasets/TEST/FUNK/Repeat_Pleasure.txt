Now that I've loved you
You know that I want it all the time
I say there's no one above you
But now there's a new bliss above that line
Now that I've known you,
The truth could never come without your smile
But I should've warned you,
We live as long as I leave 'em all behind
And an innocent sigh, I wanted all of this to never subside
I never wanna miss a moment of life, no no
Without your neck to kiss, I was thrown to the night
And now I know

Oh if you want it, guess you want it all baby
But once you got it you want something else
Even if you're holding out for something unchanging
Yeah, once it got it, you want something else

Oh if you want it, guess you want it all baby
But once you got it you want something else
Even if you're holding out for something unchanging
Yeah, once it got it, you want something else

You shout out 'I told you so'
The surface reflected in your eyes
The whole world in a dark hue
Repeated without grace and broken lies
Repeated without grace and broken lies
Now that I've known you,
The truth could never come without your smile
But I should've warned you,
We live as long as I leave 'em all behind
And an innocent sigh, I wanted all of this to never subside
I never wanna miss a moment of life
Without your neck to kiss, I was thrown to the night
And now I KNOW!
Even when we get what we wanted
This heart's break will never stop longing
PLEASURE repeats under no name
PLEASURE repeats under no name
Even broken, my heart will go on!!

Oh if you want it, guess you want it all baby
But once you got it you want something else
Even if you're holding out for something unchanging
Yeah, once it got it, you want something else

Oh if you want it, guess you want it all baby
But once you got it you want something else
Even if you're holding out for something unchanging
Yeah, once it got it, you want something else
