The very first time I looked at you
Since that day that's all I can do
So when I say that we're through

I only stop
So we could start all over again
I only stop
So we could start all over again
I only stop

Remember the day that I made you cry
When I told you goodbye
It was only her and I

I only stop
So we could start all over again
I only stop
So we could start all over again
I only stop

When things get rough, here's what we'll do
Kiss and make up, let's keep our love new
So when I say that we're through, oh, oh

I only stop
So we could start all over again (Oh)
I only stop
So we could start all over again ('Cause I love you, baby)

I only stop (Oh, oh)
So we could start all over again (So we can start all over, ooh)
I only stop
So we could start all over again (Can't you see that I love you)

I only stop (Oh, oh)
So we could start all over again ('Cause I need you, baby)
I only stop (Oh, oh)
So we could start all over again (Can't you see that I love you)
