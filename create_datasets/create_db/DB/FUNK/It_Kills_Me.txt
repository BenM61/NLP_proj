Oh yeah I've got trouble with my friends
Trouble in my life
Problems when you don't come home at night
But when you do you always start a fight

But I cant be alone, I need you to come on home
I know you messing around, but who the hell else is gonna hold me down
Oh I gotta be out my mind to think it's gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave, but the other side still believes
And it kills me to know how much I really love you

So much I wanna ooh ho oh to you hoo hoo
Should I grab his cell, call this chic up
Start some shh then hang up
Or should I be a lady

Ooh maybe cause I wanna have his babies
Oh yeah yeah cause I don't wanna be alone
I don't need to be on my own
But I love this man
But some things I just can't stand oh

I've gotta be out my mind
To think its gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave but the other half still believes
And it kills me to know how much I really love you

So much I wanna ooh hoo oh, to you hoo ho
Should I pay him back to see how he'll react,
To see if he'll react to my love, my love
Ooh I've gotta be out my mind

To think it's gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave
But the other side still believes
And it kills me to know how much
I really love you
So much I wanna oh ho to you ho ho

And it kills me (kills me)
To know how much
I really love you (how much, how much I love you)
So much I wanna oh ho to you ho ho
