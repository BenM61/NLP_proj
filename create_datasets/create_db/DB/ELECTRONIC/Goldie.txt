Goldie, 
When you had all the time in the world, 
To remember to call me, 
You were making your plans for a move, 
In the future alone

Now the summer has gone, 
And you're moving on, 
Start over again

Goldie, 
What you did, in space, when you lost, 
All your memories, 
You told me, 
To believe all the things that you said, 
When we were alone, 
Now the summer has gone, 
And we're moving on, 
Start over again

Goldie, 
You never say what you mean, 
Don't mean what you say, 
I spend hours working, 
You never get out of bed

Goldie, 
You wanna say what you want, 
What a woman should need, 
Makes me feel special, 
Makes me feel tired

Goldie, 
I'm kinda looking for something, 
I kinda think you should know, 
Love is the answer, 
All day on the phone
