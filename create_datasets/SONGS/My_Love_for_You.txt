My love for you is deep and endless as the sea
Strong and mighty as a tree
My love for you

My eager heart keeps beating just for you alone
Since the moment it has known
My love for you

There'll be no other lips, no other arms
No other love for me
Feeling as I do, how could there be?

And so it will be far beyond eternity
Ever faithful, ever true
My love for you

So it will be far beyond eternity
Ever faithful, ever true
My love for you
My love for you
