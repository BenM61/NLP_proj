Wanted to take her back to my place
Driving 90, let the cops chase
Making her damn it feels so good face
And she don't wanna wait, no, wait 'till we get home

Oh that girl she want it
Yeah she need it,
She a bad mother and I believe it

She says "pull over and don't lock the doors"
She doesn't care who sees anymore

It's better when it feels wrong
(It's better when it feels wrong)

6 miles high up in the air space
She's saying come on to the back baby
Everybody knows just what's happening
But she don't give a shit, no
She just want this ooh

Oh that girl she want it
Yeah she need it
She a bad mother and I believe it

She says come closer and don't lock the doors
She doesn't care who sees anymore

It's better when it feels wrong 
(It's better when it feels wrong)

It's better when it feels wrong
(It's better when it feels wrong)
(Feels wrong)
(Feels wrong)
It's better when it feels wrong

Wanna skrrt in that drop top? Come here
I ain't seen Max since like the summer, yeah
Count up hundreds, I stay thumbin', yeah
Count up hundreds, I stay thumbin', yeah
Now baby are you really feelin' me
Or just because what I was just talkin' about?
After I'm done you tell me you love me
I look at you, now I'll be kickin' you out
Yeah, baby tell me is it real
Baby tell me is it real
Baby tell me is it real

It's better when it feels wrong
(It's better when it feels wrong)
It's better when it feels wrong
(It's better when it feels wrong, feels wrong, feels wrong)
It's better when it feels wrong
