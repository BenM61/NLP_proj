Tonight I'm gonna love you
Tonight I'm gonna try
Tonight I will take my foot off that brake
Cause you made me grasp
What is over is past
And the world starts tonight
Oooh oooh oooh the world starts tonight

Tonight I'm gonna love you
Tonight I know I'll find
That the world still goes on
Just a part of it's gone
Cause you made me grasp
What is over is past
And the world starts tonight
Oooh oooh oooh the world starts tonight

Baby, oh baby, I made a mistake
I thought love was something, they no longer made
But since you have brought back, some love to my eyes
My doubting of people, no longer applies

Tonight I will take my foot off that brake
'Cause you made me grasp
What is over is past
And the world starts tonight
Oooh oooh oooh the world starts tonight
Oooh oooh oooh the world starts tonight
