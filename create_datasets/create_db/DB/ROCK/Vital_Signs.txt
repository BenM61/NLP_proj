Unstable condition
A symptom of life
In mental and environmental change 

Atmospheric disturbance
The feverish flux
Of human interface
And interchange 

The impulse is pure
Sometimes our circuits get shorted
By external interference

Signals get crossed
And the balance distorted 
By internal incoherence 

A tired mind become a shape-shifter
Everybody need a mood lifter
Everybody need reverse polarity 

Everybody got mixed feelings
About the function and the form
Everybody got to deviate
From the norm 

An ounce of perception
A pound of obscure
Process information
At half-speed 

Pause
Rewind, replay
Warm memory chip
Random sample
Hold the one you need 

Leave out the fiction
The fact is
This friction
Will only be worn by persistence 

Leave out conditions
Courageous convictions
Will drag the dream into existence 

A tired mind become a shape-shifter
Everybody need a soft filter
Everybody need reverse polarity 

Everybody got mixed feelings
About the function and the form
Everybody got to elevate
From the norm

Everybody got mixed feelings
Everybody got mixed feelings
Everybody got to deviate from the norm
Everybody got to deviate from the norm
Everybody got to elevate from the norm
Everybody got to elevate from the norm
Everybody got to elevate from the norm
Everybody got to elevate from the norm
Everybody got to escalate from the norm
Everybody got to elevate
Everybody got to elevate from the norm
Everybody got to deviate from the norm
