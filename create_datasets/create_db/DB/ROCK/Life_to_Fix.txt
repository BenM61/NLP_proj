I got this life to fix
Threw it all out in a ditch
Broken down when I was sick
Gotta build it back up brick by brick
I got this life to fix
Threw it all out in a ditch
Broken down when I was sick
Gotta build it back up brick by brick

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

I left my home today
I didn't have that much to say
This time alone is all I got
Singing my song in the parking lot
Every day I wake this way
Some the days I just can't take
Get that money, get that break
You ain't gonna win if you ain't gonna play

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

I like the way I feel
I'm all night, close that deal
I'm all alone, it's all I know
Singing along with the radio
Dream about you every day
I can't go back, you've gone away
Knock me down but that's okay
We all look back on yesterday
We all look back on yesterday

I got this life to fix
Threw it all out in a ditch
Broken down when I was sick
Gotta build it back up brick by brick
I got this life to fix
Threw it all out in a ditch
Broken down when I was sick
Gotta build it back up brick by brick

I got this life to fix
Threw it all out in a ditch
Broken down when I was sick
Gotta build it back up brick by brick

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

I got this life to fix
Threw it all out in a ditch
Broken down when I was sick
Build it back up brick by brick
I got this life to fix
Threw it all out in a ditch
Broken down when I was sick
build it back up brick by brick

I got this life to fix
Threw it all out in a ditch
Broken down when I was sick
Build it back up brick by brick

Whoa, whoa
Oh, build it back up, build it back up
Whoa, whoa
Good Lord, oh, build it back, build it back
Whoa, whoa
Yeah
Whoa, whoa
Build it back up brick by brick
