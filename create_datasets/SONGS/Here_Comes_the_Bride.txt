Here she comes on down the aisle
Behind her veil she wears a smile
In her hands the bright bouquet
Daddy's here to give the bride away
Best man fumbles for the band
Groom puts it on her trembling hand
Almost before the vows are through
In her calmest voice she says, "I do."

Here comes the bride
Something old
Here comes the bride
Something new
Here comes the bride
Something borrowed
And something blue

She hears the sound of little feet
But first there's a wedding cake to eat
Guests line up to kiss the bride
The groom feels like a lucky guy
Up above the church bells ring
Preacher says which psalm to sing
There was silence 'till a bride's maid sighed
And someone said, "Here comes the bride."

Here comes the bride
Something old
Here comes the bride
Something new
Here comes the bride
Something borrowed
And something blue

(You may now kiss the bride)

The veil goes back revealing bliss
The groom leans in to take his kiss

Here comes the bride
Something old
Here comes the bride
Something new
Here comes the bride
Something borrowed
And something blue...
