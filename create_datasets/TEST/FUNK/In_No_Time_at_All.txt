The moment that you smile is when it all began
And in no time at all we were best of friends
The moment that we kissed the feeling grew and grew
And in no time at all I was loving you
In no time at all you let me ride inside your heart (your heart)

We felt that we had it all
Never dreaming love could fall apart
In no time at all

So when the ending came it took me by surprise
Cause in no time at all you told me goodbye
In no time at all you let me ride inside your heart (your heart)

We felt that we had it all
Never dreaming love could fall apart
In no time at all you let me ride inside your heart (your heart)

We felt that we had it all
Never dreaming love could fall apart
In no time at all
In no time at all
