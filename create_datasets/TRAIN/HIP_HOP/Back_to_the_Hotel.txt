V-Town, brother check it out, I'm bout to throw it down
Dick in hand, you shoulda had your toke down
A little city, chillin' in the North Bay
Needless to say, my boyz don't play fool
Yorker sidin' you know how the song goes
In the back, sippin' purple chongos
Don't look for trouble but it always seems to find us, forty
Grippin' panties, sippin', and the seats are right behind us
Quick left, one blow, K.O.
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh what the hell, I guess i better tell ya
It's Friday night, I got a brand new kick on
A fifth of Henny, for me to get bent on
Hit the country club then picked up ML
Eighty west, back to the hotel

At the telly, Bones is doing butt work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The Latina in the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me baby doll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, brother striking through to be seen
A Lexus 400 to the triple gold Z's
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
Cause you know what i mean when I'm feelin' kinda funky
A sick honky, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Layin' in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the telly, I gotta get some new cock
New cock (echoes)

Ah naw, could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad want to do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her so i called TL
Soothe me up, Sally want to meet Dick
And Monty licked, so try an' make it real quick

(tick-tock)
(tick-tock)
(tick-tock)
(tick...Honk Honk)

Aw yeah, I jumped in the F-train
But wait a minute, we gotta hit the store man
I got to get some gum and some Tic-Tac's
Two tall cans and a packet of Blackjack's
We got the goods, now we're headin' for the ho down
There goes the telly, so fella won't you slow down
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case, we gotta bust a quick one
Lock the load, let's go look for like 118
But lay low cause I really don't want to be seen
Is this the room? Aw yeah, that's the right one
I got the black broad and you got the white one
So hit the lights man, I just might man
Try an' throw this thing all night an'
Get her so sprung, that she'll drop some ale
So I can catch turn and hit another hotel
