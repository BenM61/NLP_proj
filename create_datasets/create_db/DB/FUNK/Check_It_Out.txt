 And run through it 
 Doin what I do is hard to maintain my composure

 A Cock hound dank smokin nigga 'bout his cabbage

 Bathtub full of the ice and the fifths 
 My homey K-1 rollin blunts at the crib 
 First I take a hit 
 Strolls like a pimp 
 The muthafuckin savage with the million dollar limp 
 Another big day for this timin ass balla 
 Hit the block stock in my ninety fin impala 
 Let them pipes holla
