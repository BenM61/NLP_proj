I've been a restless,
For a long, long time
Tryin' to find a home
For heart of mine
The nights are lonely,
And the days are long
It?s hard to find a reason,
To carry on

But all this searchin',
Is it ever gonna end?
Must I keep on losin',
Again and again?

Tell me, how long can a man be strong?
How long must he carry on,
Without the love of a woman,
To call his own?
Tell me, how long can a man be strong ?

It?s on every man?s mind,
To find that special girl
Someone to love me,
When I'm alone in the world

But I know she's out there somewhere,
So I'm gonna keep tryin?
Someday I'm gonna find her,
It?s just a matter of time

As long as I've been waiting,
I know she's been waiting, too
Hold on a little longer,
I'm all the way to you

Now ever since this world began,
It takes a woman to make a man
Now I need someone!
Don't you know I need someone?

Ooh
But all this searchin?,
Is it ever gonna end?
Must I keep on losin?,
Again and again and again?

Yeah
Oh keep on waiting
Oh noooo
Yeah
