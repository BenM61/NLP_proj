Call me a fool, send me away
I've got to say-ay it's you I adore
Alone and in love, fallin' apart
I followed my heart 
Straight to your door

Face to face, with all honesty-why
I would be grateful if you'd give to me
O-one night, to lay-ay in your are-arms
O-one night, could it be that I was born
To make every dream
You ever had come true-ue
Woh-oh, in o-one night
Oh, one night with you-ou

Standin' this close, the sound of your voi-oice
Leaves me no choice, I offer my love
Am I so wrong to think you might fa-all
'Cause baby you're a-a-a-a-all I can think o-of

Face to face, with all honesty-why-why-why-why
I would be grateful if you'd give to me-ee
Just o-one night, to lay in your are-are-arms
O-one night, could it be that I was born
To make every dream
You ever had come true
Woh-oh, in o-one night
Oh, one night with you

O-one night, to lay in your are-arms
O-one night, could it be that I was born
For o-one night (one night)
To lay, to lay in your are-arms
O-one night (one night)
Could it be that I was born
For o-one night (one night)
I need one night (one night)
O-one night (one night) 
To lay, to lay in your are-arms
O-o-one night (one night) 
Could it be that I was born
For o-one night (one night)
Oh give me o-one night 
(One night, please, plea-ease, one night)
