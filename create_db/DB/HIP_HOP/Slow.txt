There's so much that I wanna do, to you (you, you, you, you)
First you gotta step into this room (room, room, room)
Look into my eyes
I'ma look right into yours
Cut the lights off
But don't you close the door
Tonight I'm gonna make my hallways echo you (you, you)

I pull my shirt off
Pull your jeans off
Oh baby take your time
Now turn around
As our bodies catch the mirror
Let me grind into the song
I'ma do you all night long

And now we go slow, slow, slow (you, you, you)
And now we go slow, slow, slow
Those other guys don't get it like I get it
Cause I'm with it, I get it
And they just wanna hit it
But I hear you, I pay attention
Not finished till you're finished

You're gonna get yours, I'ma get mine (i'ma get mine, I'ma get mine)
And I'ma take my time (time)
And wine my baby slow

Show me you like that slow,
Show me you like that slow
Show me you like that slow, slow, slow, slow slow
Show me you like that slow, slow slow slow slow

Baby I'ma do you till you lose your mind
Baby you're so, so freaking fine
Hey, I'ma do your body like a roller coaster
So hold on tight lay on my shoulder
And slowly but surely I'ma break that body like a cake
You're gonna sweat these sheets out
I'ma mess your hair up
And I'ma wild out on ya like I don't give a f*ck
Until it's three o'clock, four o'clock, five o'clock six
And I gotta take my time with you
Cause your shit is the shit

And now we go slow, slow, slow (you, you, you)
And now we go slow, slow, slow
Those other guys don't get it like I get it
Cause I'm with it, I get it
And they just wanna hit it
But I hear you, I pay attention
Not finished till you're finished

You're gonna get yours, I'ma get mine (i'ma get mine, I'ma get mine)
And I'ma take my time (time)
And wine my baby slow

Show me you like that slow,
Show me you like that slow, slow slow slow slow
Show me you like that slow,
Show me you like that slow, slow slow slow slow

Oh
That's it here we go
Put my love in the air
If the curtains are open I don't care it's there upstairs
I can do home alone if it's there on the staircase
Baby let me make your day
