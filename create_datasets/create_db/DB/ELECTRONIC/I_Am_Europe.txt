I'm a dog shaped ashtray
I'm a shrugging moustache wearing a speedo tuxedo
I'm a movie with no plot, written in the back seat of a piss powered taxi
I'm an imperial armpit, sweating Chianti
I'm a toilet with no seat, flushing tradition down
I'm socialist lingerie

I'm diplomatic techno
I'm gay pastry and racist cappuccino
I'm an army on holiday in a guillotine museum
I'm a painting made of hair, on a nudist beach, eating McDonald's
I'm a novel far too long
I'm a sentimental song
I'm a yellow tooth waltzing with wrap around shades on
Who am I?
I am Europe
