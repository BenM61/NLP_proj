I'm a cool latin lover libra disco king
And the ladies all scream when I'm on the scene
I got a gold plated plane to fly around the world
Just to pick up the mothers of fine little girls
I'm in the house y'all
And it's a family affair
And you can bring your sister she can clip my hair
If she ain't there well then I'm s*** outa luck
I'm in the house with mickey mouse and donald duck
You like re run
Trying to catch my truck
It's me and double chillin up in the cut
We're like starchy and hutch but a little more depth
I keep the forty on my right and the women and my left
I got a gold plated pit bull made out of ice
Yo his bark ain't loud but he sure ain't nice
And if you ask me twice
I'm going to tell you the same
It's rap basketball and doctor j is the name
'Cause I'm bound to go down in the hall of fame
And you can see my picture chillin up in the gold frame
Type that y'all
And you just don't stop
And that ya playing pac-man and running from the cops
It's like a nice chocolate Sunday with a cherry on top
I got a leather cadillac and I love to hip-hop
'Cause people always saying p ain't about nothing
But that's for the birds like thanksgiving stuffing
'Cause when I disco
I always prove my point
Yo I'm out baby brother
Pass over the joint and

Hang loose y'all

Hang loose

Hang loose y'all

Hang loose

Real fresh, haha
Like a lady that just gave birth
Double k is my name and la is my turf
I said we party all night like kool and the gang
Me and the little brother thes came to show our fame
We break the girls hearts and make the jams start
Surprise the sleepy kids like a fresh pop-tart
We up jump the boogie like scooby-doo
Smoke a doobie or two
And hanging out with the crew
I keep the green trees
So my car smells fresh
Take a bath with diamonds
I only bought the best
Keep my ladies well dressed
Never settle for less
Like a cold can of miller straight out the ice chest
I don't wear calvin klein
I wear louis vuitton
And that's word to you mothers and brothers of islam
Party people live long 'cause it's just begun
Got an intersect race just to have some fun
We're the cool party rockers
The old folk shocker
The whack rhyme stopper
Take a piece of something proper
I'm out for the cash
Gonna have a blast
Couple friends and some a** smoking up my hash
Got a smile on my face 'cause I own the place
I got rhymes from detroit straight to outaspace
Emcee's shut their trap
While I kick the old rap
Party down with my friends some skinny some fat
But one thing is for sure when we all hang loose
We tell stories bout our rhymes like mother goose
Or dr. seuess
It's the rap in the hat
So take that party people, take that haha
Hang loose

Hang loose y'all

Hang loose

Hang loose y'all
