This song is dedicated to some people, 
With whom I had the pleasure of living over half the years I've lived, 
'til now, when we come to our fork in the road.

And though our feet may travel a different path from now on, 
I want them to know how I feel about them, and that I wish them well.

Sweet harmony,
Go on and and blow on.
Stay in perfect tune,
With your own familiar song.

Make the world aware,
That you're still goin' strong.
Go on,
Spread your joy around the world.
Spread your joy around the world.

Sweet harmony,
Yeah, yeah.
Go on and blow on.

I believe in miracles,
If you can dream it,
It can be done.

And though a task was made for two,
It can be done well by one.
Go on,
Spread your joy around the world.
Spread your joy around the world.
Ew

Sweet harmony,
Spread your joy around the world.
Ew
Sweet harmony,
Go on,
Spread your joy around the world.
Sweet harmony,
Ew

Sweet harmony,
Go on and go.

You were the prelude for the song,
The village minstrels play.
Though most of them have come and gone,
You're still around today,
Go on,
Spread your joy around the world.

Harmony, huh!
Spread your joy around the world.
Keep on!
Sweet harmony,
Ew,
To every heart and soul,
You know the joy you bring,
When you do your thing.

Sweet harmony,
Yeah!

Don't stop now,
No

Sweet harmony,
I believe
Spread your joy around the world.
Sweet harmony
