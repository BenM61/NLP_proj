I was right and you were wrong girl
Nothing lasts forever
Inside every one of us
There's only so long

I believe the longest day girl
The lovely light of May girl
If asked if I could ever leave
I never saw a change

But I will
What I say
What I do

I was right and you were wrong girl
Nothing seems the same
I heard you on the radio
Your voice was so strange

But I will
What I say
What I do
