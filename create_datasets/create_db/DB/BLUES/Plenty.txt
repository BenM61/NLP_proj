Roll with me till we're dizzy down these green grassy hills
We'll lay at the bottom
And watch the clouds spin
Get up, run to the top 
We'll do it all again
There is plenty, There is plenty of all we need
Sunshine on our backs
The sweet air we breathe
Ain't no hurry
There's no place I've got to be
Just right here loving you
Yeah with you loving me
Climb with me up this apple tree and we'll sit a while up there
Just to see what we can see
Come on I double dare you
I'll pick the best fruit just for you
And I'll rub it till it shines
Let your legs dangle down and we'll talk about
What ever is on our minds
There is plenty
There is plenty of all we need
Sunshine on our backs
The sweet air we breathe
I'm not worried
There's no place I'd rather be
Just right here loving you
With you loving me
