I am coming from the edge of madness
A northern mourns the world of men
Gonna drive them into exile
Or never let them breathe again

On that night under the raging northern sky
The seeds of legend lie
Swollen almost to a man
The war of kings began

In a land thrown into darkness
An army would arise
The heathens died laughing
At the kings bent his bone high

On that night under the raging northern sky
The seeds of legend lie
Swollen almost to a man
The war of kings began

On that night under the raging northern sky
The seeds of legend lie
Swollen almost to a man
The war of kings began
The war of kings began
The war of kings began
