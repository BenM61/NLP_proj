Well, don't get me wrong, I won't hurt myself
Back in the 80's, straight off the shelves
I even enrolled in the old school of cool
But how quickly I learned to be nobody's fool

Don't wanna live in an Adidas world
With the Adidas boys and the Adidas girls
Don't wanna live in an Adidas world
With the Adidas boys and the Adidas girls

I tried it once or twice, but let's not be wrong
You can't defeat the enemy by singing his song
Adi Dassler, have you heard the news?
Gonna stomp all over your three-stripe shoes

Don't wanna live in an Adidas world
With the Adidas boys and the Adidas girls
Don't wanna live in an Adidas world
With the Adidas boys and the Adidas girls

You've gotta kowtow to the corporate cow
To the new superpowers I respectfully bow
Adidas, Nike, I salute your name
But I've twisted my ankle, so I'm out of the game

Don't wanna live in an Adidas world
With the Adidas boys and the Adidas girls
Don't wanna live in an Adidas world
With the Adidas boys and the Adidas girls
Don't wanna live in an Adidas world
With the Adidas boys and the Adidas girls
Don't wanna live in an Adidas world
With the Adidas boys and the Adidas girls
