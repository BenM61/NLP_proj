But lemme know if it's getting too late
And if not then I could catch me another

Big spaces out churr like a hundred yards

On any motherfuckers who ain't throwin' wit us

You see me poppin' bottles at the bar

Please don't put 'cha bet down mo'
If it ain't four or better
I'm talking Pete Rose at the end of the road
Playboy f*ck what you was told

City scoped the whole hood
We be lookin' for the ones in tight jeans
The lust (the lust) never good

But I was reachin' for your arm
When you walked past
And I missed and I grabbed your ass
My bizzard
Feels like I'm learnin' 35
In a A3 cup in a Deezeevees
Whatever I desire (desire)
I want a 600 coupe wit the laser cut key
Before (before) I retire
Baby girl I got to have it all
8 cars in a stall
Them planks down the hall
Where the draws gon' fall
Coolest nigga ever seen (seen)
It ain't shit my nigga I'll show ya
Ones on triple-beam
Let it on out baby girl don't you know
I love to hear you scream

Somethin' like a daughter
I finally caught her
Lil' chicky like a fish outta water (water water)

[Chorus: x2]

Now ladies put your hands up
And bounce with me now
Fellas put your hands down
And smack a lil' ass with me now
Gon' give that girl the eye
And tell 'em meet you outside
'cause we ain't got nowhurr to (gooo but home)
And see about the curb (the curb)

Tell me can you drive a stick

Give me your birth date and your birth sign (scorpio)
Same as mine

On natural bridge down the King's highway
We will chill in (chillin') with my peeps (my peeps)
That L-you-N-A-T-I-see
Oh you fo' reel
We're not filthy rich but we could use a bath
Let a chick take half
Don't want that math
And I speak on behalf of my whole damn staff
I can see (see) what you thinkin'
You know you want it as bad as I do
Tell me (tell me) what you drinkin'

And that shit stankin' (stankin')
Like Cali chronic for them LA boys
That purple haze for them glassy jars
F*ck Lana, baby I want Mo

And bounce with me now
Smack a lil' ass with me now
Tell 'em meet you outside
Cause we got nowhere to go, but home
