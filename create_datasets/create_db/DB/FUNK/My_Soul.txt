Why you wanna make me cry?
Aren't you tired of disappointing me?
Don't you know that I deserve better than you ever gave to me?
You know it's just the way I give, you take, baby

Every time I'm up then you come around and you try to bring me down
(My soul)
Keeps on telling me that I've gotta let you go
(My soul)
And with all your lies boy, you've tainted everything
My soul, I've gotta let you go, 'cause I know you're poisoning my soul

And everything you promised me, I know it could never be

Remember when you gave me strength
Baby, now you only make me weak
I pray somehow that I can break
The spell you put on me

Every time I'm up then you come around and you try to bring me down
(My soul)
Keeps on telling me that I've gotta let you go
(My soul)
And with all your lies boy, you've tainted everything
My soul, I've gotta let you go, 'cause I know you're poisoning my soul

And everything you promised me, I know it could never be
(I know It could never be)
Every everything you promised me
(Promised me)
I know it could never be

(I can't live without you, I can't live without you
I can't live without your love)
You keep telling me and when you come around
I just break on down
'Cause I know you no good, I can't live without your love
