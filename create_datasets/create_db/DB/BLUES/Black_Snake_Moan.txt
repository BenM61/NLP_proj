Some pretty mama better come and get this black snake soon
Ohh-oh, that must have been a bed bug, baby a chinch

Can't bite that hard
Ohh-oh, that must have been a bed bug, honey a chinch

Ask my sugar for fifty cents, she said "Lemon, ain't a

Mama, that's all right, mama that's all right for you
Mama, that's all right, mama that's all right for you
