Come to me baby, don't be shy
Don't be shy, don't be shy
Come to me baby don't be shy

It was a summer time, that summer high
Oh what a masterpiece
The way your eyes met mine
Sweet like apple pie, caught in your energy
The future came to me, I see

Yeah, it feels so classic
You and me, the magic
And I know we have it
'Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic
'Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic

Oh what a summer time, when we lost our minds
Between the birds and bees
Buzzing under blue sky till the full moon rise
Playing with chemistry
Baby are you with me,? Oh

Yeah, it feels so classic
You and me, the magic
And I know we have it
'Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic, hmmm
'Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic, hmmm

We're just looking for the fun here
We don't know what's gonna come, yeah
Just looking for the fun here
