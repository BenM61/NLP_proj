Got a tattoo that said "together through life"
Carved in your name with my poker knife
And you wonder when you wake up, will it be alright oh oh
Feels like there's something broken inside

All I know
All I know
Is that in lost whenever you go
All I know is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Got a tattoo and that paint is alright
Just wanted a way of keeping you inside (oh oh oh oh oh)

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire bellow
All I know is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

I see the road begin to climb
I see the stars, begin to show
I see your colors and I'm dying of thirst

All I know is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
Oh yeah yeah yeah
So much that it hurts
So much that it hurts
