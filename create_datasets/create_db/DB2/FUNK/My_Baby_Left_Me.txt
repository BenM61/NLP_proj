Oh yeah
My baby left my sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me dry
My baby left my sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me so dry to the bone
And he left me alone
Oh yeah

Consequences after murder?
Situations did you further
Close one eye and dream the rest
I was called the early learner
And you were the heart stirrer?
But this I never coulda guessed
You pulled on me until you knew I'd break

My baby left my sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me dry
My baby left my sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me so dry to the bone
And he left me alone
Oh yeah

So who's to blame for the messy ending
You say it's me but we'd be pretending
You work your dirt just like a pro
Cos you were a
Freedom fighter, compulsive liar,
And a really good lucky trier
More than I had ever known
You pulled on me until you knew I'd break

My baby left my sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me dry
My baby left my sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me so dry to the bone
And he left me alone
And he left me alone
And he left me alone
