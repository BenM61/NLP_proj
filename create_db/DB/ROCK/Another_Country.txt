Lost hours and secrets too,
No one will find but you,
Falling is like brand new rain,
Places I have never been,
I thought these things would come to me
Love is another country, and I want to go

[Chorus]
I want to go too, I want to go with you
I want to go too, I want to go with you

But I'm broke down right here
My heart won't come out clear
I get lost on the inside too
How could I make sense to you?
And when you walk away from me,
You're further than another country and I want to go

[Chorus]

If you should lose you place,
This world should hide its face
And go where you can't follow to,
I will come and look for you,
And you can just hold onto me,
Strangers in another country cause I want to go

[Chorus]
