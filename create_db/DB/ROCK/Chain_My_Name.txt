So are we made just to fight
All our lives
End it all on the bottom dotted line
Hold back my hair
While you kiss my face
When laying my body down
I erase your face
Hold back my hair
While you kiss my face
When laying my body down
I erase your face

Who am I?
He heard me
Who am I?
He heard me
Who am I?
Heard my name 
And it changed that day

So are we made just to fight?
All our lives
End it all 
So are we made just to fight?
All our lives
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name inside you
So are we made just to fight?
All our lives
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name inside you
Not this time
Not this time
Please not this time

Who am I?
He heard me
Who am I?
He heard me
Who am I?
Heard my name and it changed that day

So are we made just to fight?
All our lives
End it all the bottom line
So are we made just to fight?
All our lives
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name inside you
So are we made just to fight?
All our lives
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name inside you
Not this time

Don't make it easier on me
Have you had enough?
I'll make it easier on you
No I can't be trusted with love

So are we made just to fight?
All our lives
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name inside you
So are we made just to fight?
All our lives
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name
Chain my name inside you
Not this time
