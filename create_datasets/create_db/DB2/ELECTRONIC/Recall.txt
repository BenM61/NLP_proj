Party people, got yourself a recall.
Party people come to party, y'all.
Everybody gonna see what to do, how to be.
Before you, before me, come to party.

Yes y'all, you're having a ball.
Go blow the horn and sound the recall.
Spread the word from here to Timbuktu.
Have you heard its comin' through?
Right now, from back up down.
Party all around town.
All of the party people get busy.
Party hearty till you get dizzy.

Party people got yourself a recall.
Party people come to party, y'all.
Everybody gonna see, what to do, how to be.
Before you, before me, come to party.

Come along, come along.
Everybody come down to the party.
Make my day, c'mon shake your body.
Make my day, give up and give your smile.
All the way, live up a simple life style.
Some say you're foul, n' some say you puke,
Though I don't give a hoot, shoot.
You're here tonight to show us your stuff. 
Knocked yourself out, like you can' get enough.
