featuring De La Soul 

(And now for my next number....I'd like to return to the classics. Perhaps 
the most famous classic   ) 

Pos: 
Yo  yo  excuse me 
I heard the word from word of mouth 
That you were into booking flights 
My  travel agent took a trip up north 
And I need to book a flight tonight 
I  enjoyed a getting away from day  
To day stress so I need to leave 
Soon. (If that's a case, I have no space 
But for later I'd be sore to (leave?)) 
Nah, nah, that's not gonna do, I know that you 
Can find another flight leavin the same 
Time. I need to get aboard. I can't afford 
Any penalties to sit in the main cabin 
(yo, that didn't rhyme) It doesn't matter (What does? The money. 
Show the cash and the ticket is yours) 
Cool. Here's your green. Now I'm up outta the scene 
But I'll be back to purchase some more 
Jewels. 

Chorus: 
(I like it) More than you know it 
(I like it) More than you know it 
(do you want me baby) I want some mo'! 
(do you want me sugar) I want some mo'! 
(I like it) (I like it!) 
(I like it) (I love it!) 

Pos: 
Now I'm comin down outta the clouds 
And I'm runnin into turbulence 
Need to get up, up higher again 
Feelin like my soul's on fire again 
Don't need to bail for safety, show me where the safe be 
So I can take me another trip 
To the agency, cause the travel unravel my woes 
But now the craving grows 
So, I need to get a ticket cause man, oh I, 
Need to get aboard a plane again 
Some, say I'll crash, but It's my life and cash 
Gonna write it out until the end 
Numb, to the lift of the whiff, (grow?), when I vacate frequently 
And I got, frequent flyer when I retire to death 
Tell 'em that the big see sent me 
And a lot, of brothers man. I'm not the only brother 
At the airport, needin a lift 
Off. Was a agent til I was caught and brought 
To an unfair court, pleadin the fifth 
Soft, ground I prefer upon the mound 
When I pinched a rock for a fee 
Now others say standin at the bat isn't where it's at 
But takin hits is where I'd rather be 

Chorus 

Dove: 
Now I bagged this chick but she got me wide 
Made me lose my friends and my pride 
Had me cashing my checks for her 
Lost all my self-respect for her 
When I was broke she'd go solicit other guys 
And if we made love you could see it in my eyes 
My fantasy was one day to be a millionaire 
So I could reassure that my baby girl was there 
I could feel her love, son, I taste it in her lips 
Mentally she was a trip, had a nigga whipped 
A lot of other cats got strung out in the past 
But I'ma get the love last, then I make a dash 
That's what I thought but Miss Thing was too appealing 
When I had no dough for her, she had a nigga stealing 
(Hands hot) Now I'm incarcerated, honey ain't around 
Into withdrawal from her, while I'm locked down 
Two years down I hear she's still a thick dime 
Controllin niggas pockets and even ladies' minds 
(Here she come) ? with a temptin proposition 
(Approaching me) But when she said "Hi" I had to listen 
I'm sweatin beans cause I know I'm gonna bait her 
Better do it now cause you're bound to do it later 
I can't refuse her, my denial's a wish 
Fell into her arm when I gave her a kiss 
Cause I like it 

Chorus
