I can still hear their laughter echo
And the taste of blood in my mouth
How much more can you ask for
You know I already died once before

Can not give away anymore
It's getting to the point where I want nothing at all
Everything I see just burns my eyes

Dancing with the dead
I don't want to remember but I cannot forget
Dancing with the dead
Because too much was never enough

You got me right where you want me
And it's creeping down my spine
All I wanted was nothing
Why don't you step aside

I don't wanna give away anymore
It's getting to the point where I want nothing all
It's scary and twisting my mind
I can not hide

Dancing with the dead
I don't want to remember but I cannot forget
Dancing with the dead
Because too much was never enough

Dancing with the dead
Fear was all that was left when everything turned black
Dancing with the dead
Because too much is never enough
Too much is never enough

I've been dancing with the dead
I don't want to remember but I cannot forget
Dancing with the dead
Because too much was never enough

Dancing with the dead
Fear was all that was left when everything turned black
Dancing with the dead
Because too much was never enough

Dancing with the dead
I've been dancing with the dead
Dancing with the dead
It's never enough

Dancing with the dead
I've been dancing with the dead
Dancing with the dead
It's never enough
