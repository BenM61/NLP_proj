You are a sickness 
My only sincere plague.
Is this what you've worked for? 
Running your false empire to the ground.

What is this substance 
That made your very own morals change?

It's gone a little too far to turn back now. 
(turn back now) 
It's gone a little too far to turn back.
Always running I am the outcast. 
Keep running, keep running away.

On to the next one, how can you have no shame?
Gone (gone) is your reason, 
Think of from where you came. 
(where you came)
God as my witness, there will be no love lost.

This is my vengeance 
From here on out it's no regrets.
You are my sickness 
I gave it all my very best.
This is my vengeance 
From here on out it's no regrets.
You are my sickness 
I gave it all my very best. 
(my very best)

It's gone a little too far to turn back now. 
(turn back now)
It's gone a little too far to turn back. 
Always running I am the outcast.
It's gone a little too far to turn back now. 
(it's gone a little too far) (turn back now)
It's gone a little too far to turn back. 
Always running I am the outcast.
Keep running, keep running away.

On to the next one, 
Driven by what you gain. 

Broken honor, 
You came and you went.

We're just another crack in the wall, 
Here with no love lost. (no love lost)
