It's ten o'Clock in the morning
Can't get out of my bed
And I can't get you out of my head
I reach over and touch someone
But it isn't you who is there
Never did like love affairs

Said goodbye to my kid
Said goodbye to my wife
Packed up my bags, put them in my car
And said goodbye to this life
Everybody said I was crazy
How could lever leave you this way
I've been thinking a lot about you girl, today 

I will be with you again
I will be with you again
I will be with you again

Everybody is staring at me
Everybody looks so concerned
I wish they could listen to me
There's a lesson here to be learned
I haven't felt this good for a long time
So won't you please leave me be
Let me swim in the sea of tranquility

I will be with you again
I will be with you again
I will be with you again

Set me free

I wish I could talk through your heart
I wish you could hear what I say
Even though we're miles apart
You're with me every step of the way

I will be with you again

I will be with you one of these days 'Cause
I can't fee I nothin' but love
Thats all I feel
I can feet you, can you feel me?
'Cause your love has set me free
