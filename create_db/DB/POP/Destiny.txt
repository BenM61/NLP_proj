What if I never knew
What if I never found you
I'd never have this feeling in my heart

How did this come to be
I don't know how you found me
But from the moment I saw you
Deep inside my heart I knew

Baby your my destiny
You and I were meant to be
With all my heart and soul
I give my love to have and hold
And as far as I can see
You were always meant to be my destiny

I wanted some one like you
Someone that I could hold on to
And give my love until the end of time

But forever was just a word, just a word
Something I'd only heard about
But now your always there for me
When you say forever I'll believe

Baby your my destiny
You and I were meant to be
With all my heart and soul
I give my love to have and hold
And as far as I can see
You were always meant to be my destiny

Maybe all we need is just a little faith
Cause baby I believe that love will find a way

Baby your my destiny
You and I were meant to be
With all my heart and soul
I give my love to have and hold
And as far as I can see
From now until eternity
You were always meant to be
My destiny
Your my destiny
