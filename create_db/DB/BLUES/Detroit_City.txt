I want to go home, I want to go home,
Oh Lord, I want to go home.

Last night I went to sleep in Detroit city,
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home,
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother,
And I dreamed about that girl, who's been waitin' for so long

I want to go home, I want to go home,
Oh Lord, I want to go home

Home folks think I'm big in Detroit city,
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine,
But by day I make the cars, and by night I make the bars,
If only they could read between the lines

I want to go home, I want to go home,
Oh Lord, I want to go home

You know, I rode a freight train north to Detroit city,
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time,
So I think I'll take my foolish pride, put it on a southbound freight and ride,
Go on back to the ones I left, who've been waitin' for so long

I want to go home, I want to go home,
Oh Lord, I want to go home.
