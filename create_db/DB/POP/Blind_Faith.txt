Love is kind of blind faith
Baby, I know you've been hurt before
But I'd love if you wanted more
Baby, I know you've been hurt before

Love is what your heart is for
Baby, I know you've been hurt before
But I'd love if you wanted more
Baby, I know you've been hurt before

So close your mouth
You talk too much, you know
I can feel your scars
Why won't you let them show

Just let it all go, let it all go, let it all go
You're never alone, never alone, never alone
It's blind faith

Love is kind of blind faith
Baby, I know you've been hurt before
But I'd love if you wanted more
Baby, I know you've been hurt before

Love is what your heart is for
Baby, I know you've been hurt before
But I'd love if you wanted more
Baby, I know you've been hurt before

Just let it all go, let it all go, let it all go
You're never alone, never alone, never alone
Just let it all go, let it all go, let it all go
You're never alone, never alone, never alone
It's blind faith
