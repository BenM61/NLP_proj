I wanna tell you 'bout a dance
That's goin' around
Ev'rybody doin' it
From the grownups, down

Don't have to move yo' head
Don't have to move yo' hands
Don't have to move yo' lips
Just shake yo' hips

And do the hip-shake, baby
And do the hip-shake, baby
Do the hip-shake, baby
Shake yo' hips, baby

Now, if you don't know
Don't be afraid
Just listen to me
And do what I said

Don't move yo' head
Don't move yo' hands
Don't move yo' lips
Just shake yo' hips

Do the hip-shake, baby
Do the hip-shake, baby
Do the hip-shake, baby
Shake yo' hips, baby

Now, ain't this easy?

Well, I met a little girl
In a country town
She says, 'what'd you know? '
'There's Slim Harpo!'

I didn't move my head
I didn't move my hands
I didn't move my lips
She shook her hips

She did a hip shake, baby
Did her hip shake, baby
Did her hip shake, baby
Shake yo' hips, baby

Now, ain't this easy?
