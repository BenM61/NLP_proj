Down a bush track off a dirt road
No milkbar no postcode
In the state of blissed out mind
It's always nineteen sixty nine

When hippy boy meets hippy girl
In Brunswick street tonight 
She'll take him back to the hippy hut
Where everything's allright
Take off her cheesecloth kaftan
And brew some Jasmine tea
Read Kerouac and Ginsberg
And trip on poetry

Yeah we live our lives in a hippy hut
Our front door is never shut
There's love and peace out in the bush
Away from all that shove and push
Our Kombi van goes put put put
To our happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut

Wear a headband seek nirvana
Pack a bong and smoke banana
Tofu Gut and Lily Ponds
They dance along in leather thongs
We'll build a mudbrick heaven 
Wear flowers in our hair
Potbelly stove and windchimes
Seagrass everywhere

We  live our lives in a hippy hut
Our front door is never shut
There's love and peace out in the bush
Away from all that shove and push
And our Kombi van goes put put put
To our happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut

Now hippy girl and hippy guy
Lay the mattress on the floor
Burn that incense all night long
Submit to cosmic law

I searched the world for the Holy Grail
Pinned the donkey on the tail
I knew my life was in a rut
Till I found my hippy hut
Now we drink rainwater from a tank
Most of the time our mind's a blank
I get to feel just like a king
Up here where the bellbirds sing

We live our lives in a hippy hut  
Our front door is never shut
It's the shack we call our home
And we never feel alone
Our Kombi van goes put put put
To our happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut
We all live in a hippy hut
Share the tomb with old King Tut
There's love and peace out in the bush
Away from all that shove and push
Our Kombi van goes put put put
To our happy hippy happy hippy hippy hut
