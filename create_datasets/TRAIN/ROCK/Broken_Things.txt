You can have my heart, though it isn't new
It's been used and broken, and only comes in blue
It's been down a long road, and it got dirty along the way
If I give it to you, will you make it clean
And wash the shame away?

You can have my heart, if you don't mind broken things
You can have my life; you don't mind these tears
Well, I heard that you make old things new
So I give these pieces all to you
If you want it, you can have my heart

So beyond repair, nothing I could do
I tried to fix it myself
But it was only worse when I got through
Then you walk right into my darkness
And you speak words so sweet
And you hold me like a child 
'til my frozen tears fall at your feet

You can have my heart, if you don't mind broken things
You can have my life if you don't mind these tears
Well, I heard that you make old things new
So I give these pieces up to you
If you want it, you can have my heart
