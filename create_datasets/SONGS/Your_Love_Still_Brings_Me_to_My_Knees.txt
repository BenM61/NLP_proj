Your love still brings me to my knees
From day to day you feel my needs
This flame that burns
Within my heart will never die

Oh, I bless the day you came along
You turned my life into a song
There is no greater love
And there will never be
'cause you're the only one
(your love still brings me to my knees)
Still bring me to my knees
You're the one, you're the one I long to please, oh darling, ah, ha
(your love still brings me to my knees)
(your love is killing me)

Oh, I find each day I love you more
Always the one I'm waiting for
No matter where I go
No matter what I do
'cause you're the only one
(your love still brings me to my knees)
Still brings me to my knees
Ah, you're the one I long to please, oh darling, ooh, aah, ooh
(your love still brings me to my knees)
(your love is killing me)

Now I never knew
What love was all about, yeah
Then you came along
Gave me a reason to stand up and shout, oh I love you
Oh darling

Your love still brings me to my knees
From day to day you feel my needs
There is no greater love
And there will never be
'cause you're the only one
(your love still brings me to my knees)
Still brings me to my knees
(your love is killing me)
(you're the one, you're the one I long to please
Still brings me to my knees
(your love still brings me to my knees)
Yes it does, sweet baby, ooh, ah
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, yeah
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
