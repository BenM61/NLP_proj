There it stands in the corner with the barrel so straight
I looked out the winder and over the gate
The big fat rabbits are jumpin' in the grass
Wait 'til they hear my old shotgun blast

Shotgun boogie, I done saw your track
Look out Mr.Rabbit when I cock my hammer back

Well, over on the ridge is a scaly bark
Hickory nuts so big you can see 'em in the dark
The big fat squirrels, they scratch and they fight
I'll be on that ridge before daylight

With a shotgun boogie, all I need is one shot
Look out bushy tails, tonight you'll be in the pot

Well, I met a pretty gal, she was tall and thin
I asked her what she had, she said, "A fox four ten"
I looked her up and down, said, "Boy, this is love"
So we headed for the brush to shoot a big fat dove

Shotgun boogie, boy, the feathers flew
Look out Mr.Dove when she draws a bead on you

I sat down on a log, took her on my lap
She said wait a minute bud, you got to see my pap
He's gotta sixteen gauge choked down like a rifle
He don't like a man that's gonna trifle

Shotgun boogie, draws a bead so fine
Look out big boy, he's loaded all the time

Well, I called on her pap like a gentleman oughter
He said, "No brush hunter's gonna get my daughter"
He cocked back the hammer right on the spot
When the gun went off I outrun the shot

Shotgun boogie, I wanted weddin' bells
I'll be back little gal, when your pappy runs out of shells
