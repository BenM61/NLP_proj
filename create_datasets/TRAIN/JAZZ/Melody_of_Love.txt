Waltz tempo
Hold me in your arms, dear, dream with me
Cradled by your kisses, tenderly
While a choir of angels from above
Sings our melody of love

Instrumental break
Heart to heart forever, lips entwined
I am yours and you are mine, all mine
Heaven wrote the music up above
For our melody of love

Melody of love
