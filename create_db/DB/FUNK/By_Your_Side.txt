No need to worry
Love's in no hurry
Just take your time
Love's by your side

Ooh, you're wandering free
Searchin' for love that you really need
Don't look no further
Love's by your side

Just wanna touch
Let me feel your light
Ooh, means so much, yeah...
I want you to touch me
Let me be your light
Don't let love slip, baby, why don't you stay

There's no need to worry, no, baby
Love's in no hurry
Just take your time
Love's by your side

No...oh...oh...

Just wanna touch
Let me feel your light
Ooh, means so much, yeah...
I want you to touch me
Let me be your light
Don't let love slip, baby, why don't you stay

There's no need to worry, no, baby
Love's in no hurry
Just take your time
Love's by your side

Oh...oh...yeah...
