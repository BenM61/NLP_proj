So messed up, I want you here
In my room, I want you here
Now we're gonna be face-to-face
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place

And now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
Well, come on

Now I'm ready to close my eyes
And now I'm ready to close my mind
And now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart on the burning sands

And now I want to be your dog
And now I wanna be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
Well, come on
