I sometimes wish I was a kid again
Down in the old neighborhood
Just to be with Charlie, with little Joe and Pete
Boy, we had a quartette that was mighty hard to beat
I'd love to stand down by that cellar door
Just to hear that quartette sing once more
 
"Heart Of My Heart", I love that melody
"Heart Of My Heart" brings back a memory
When we were kids on the corner of the street
We were rough and ready guys
But Oh! How we could harmonize
"Heart Of My Heart"
Meant friends were dearer then
Too bad we had to part
I know a tear would glisten if once more I could listen
To that gang that sang "Heart Of My Heart"
 
"Heart Of My Heart", I love that melody
"Heart Of My Heart" brings back a memory
When we were kids on the corner of the street
We were rough and ready guys
But Oh! How we could harmonize
"Heart Of My Heart"
Meant friends were dearer then
Too bad we had to part
I know a tear would glisten if once more I could listen
To that gang that sang "Heart Of My Heart"
