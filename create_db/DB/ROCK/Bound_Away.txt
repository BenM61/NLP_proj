I'm an unknown individual in an unattended car
Hey, welcome to Chicago or wherever you are
New York to London, Barcelona to Berlin
Sacramento, California, we are leaving again

Away, away, away, away
Away, I'm bound away

I'm circling, I'm swiveling, I'm waiting just to land
I'm trying to come home, but I'm here with the band
Traveling, unraveling, I'm staying on track
My plastic utensil has broken in half

Away, away, away, away
Away, I'm bound away

There's low visibility, gusty wind and rain
My carry-on luggage is still on the plane
Seconds turn to minutes, minutes turn to hours
Hours give you a lifetime and a grave with pink flowers

Away, away, away, away
Away, I'm bound
Away, away, away, away
Away, I'm bound away

Away, I'm bound
Away
