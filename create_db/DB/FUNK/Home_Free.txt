I'm trying hard not to think you unkind 
But Heavenly Father 
If you know my heart 
Surely you can read my mind 
Good people underneath the sea of grief 
Some get up and walk away 
Some will find ultimate relief 

[Chorus] 
Home Free, eventually 
At the ultimate healing we will be Home Free 
Home Free, oh I've got a feeling 
At the ultimate healing 
We will be Home Free 

Out in the corridors we pray for life 
A mother for her baby, A husband for his wife 
Sometimes the good die young 
It's sad but true 
And while we pray for one more heartbeat 
The real comfort is with you 

You know pain has little mercy 
And suffering's no respecter of age, of race or position 
I know every prayer gets answered 
But the hardest one to pray is slow to come 
Oh Lord, not mine, but Thy will be done 

Let it be... 

[Chorus]  

Home Free, eventually 
At the ultimate healing gonna be Home Free 
Home Free, oh its more than a feeling 
At the ultimate healing 
Gonna be Home Free
