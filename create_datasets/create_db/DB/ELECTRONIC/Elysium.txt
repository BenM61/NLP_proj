No one has said what the truth should be
And no one decided that I'd feel this way
If you felt as I
Would you betray yourself
But, you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me
No one should fear what they cannot see
And no ones to blame it's just hypocrisy
It's written in your eyes
And how I despise myself
But, you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me
And it's your heart
That's so wrong
Mistaken
You'll never know
Your feathered sacred self
But, you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me
And you can't deny how I feel
And why should you decide for me
