Friends, inquisitive friends
Are asking me what's come over me
There's been a change (there's been a change)
And it's oh so plain to see

Love just walked in on me
And it's taken me by surprise
Happiness surrounds me
You can see it in my eyes

Now it was just a little while ago
My life was was incomplete
I was down so doggone low
Had to look up at my feet

Don't you know that 
I just want to testify
What your love has done for me
I just want to testify
What your love has done for me

Once I was a hollow man
In which a lonely heart did dwell
You know love came creeping upon me
Bringing life to an empty shell

Now I heard so many times before
That your love could be so bad
I just want to tell you people
It's the best love I ever had

Don't you know that 
I just want to testify
What your love has done for me
I just want to testify
What your love has done for me

Ooh, ooh luscious
Sure been delicious to me
Ooh, ooh luscious
Sure been delicious to me

I just want to testify
What your love has done for me
I just want to testify
What your love has done for me
