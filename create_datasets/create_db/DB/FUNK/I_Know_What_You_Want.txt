Played around and I played the field
I was one mad dog girl you know for real
And I didn't give a damn just who I hurt
Spent all my time just chasing skirt

Now I met a girl like you
Tell me what's this man supposed to do?
It feels like love I must confess
'Cause it rips my heart right from my chest
Everytime she says

(Woman) I know what you want
You just want to run your game
(Jacksoul) All the girls, them dub me shady
I just want you to be my baby
(Woman) I know what you want
You just want to tell your crew
(Jacksoul) Now at last it's love I find
But she can't leave my prayers behind

I can tell right from the look in your eyes
You been hearin' some stories and there all lies
But whether there lies or whether there true
I'd never run no game on you, no

(Woman) I know what you want
You just want to run your game
(Jacksoul) All the girls, them dub me shady
I just want you to be my baby
(Woman) I know what you want
You just want to tell your crew
(Jacksoul) Now at last it's love I find
But you can't leave my prayers behind

Would you cheat, would you holla?
Once you cheat, nobody's gonna swallow
Would you turn your life around and in the end
She's gonna listen to my friend

Just the hundredth time, it's taking a week
But you would take my cars, you won't even speak to me
All that doing is in the past
Please believe that's all I have

(Woman) I know what you want
You just want to run your game
(Jacksoul) All the girls, them dub me shady
I just want you to be my baby
(Woman) I know what you want
You just want to tell your crew
(Jacksoul) Now at last it's love I find
But she can't leave my prayers behind

(Woman) I know what you want
You just want to run your game
(Jacksoul) All the girls, them dub me shady
I just want you to be my baby
(Woman) I know what you want
You just want to tell your crew
(Jacksoul) Now at last it's love I find
But she can't leave my prayers behind
