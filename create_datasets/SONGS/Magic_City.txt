I was looking for love
Was looking for love
In all the wrong places
I was looking for love
I was looking for love
In Magic City
I was looking for love
Was looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oooh

I never be considered a trick in my life,
Bring a couple bad girls then I just might
Tip her, if your stripping I'm tipping
I got a couple of dollars I'm spending
If she got ass and nice long legs,
She can have a piece of my bread
'Cause honestly I'll do anything for love
Not tryna fall for anything.

Cause I was looking for love
Was looking for love
In Magic City
In the long run
When you do it like that,
Your gonna be all alone
I was looking for love
Was looking for love
In all the wrong places

Every dollar when your living like that
Your gonna be all alone
I don't care when it comes to love I been treated unfair
It seems to escape me homie be out to bang
I wasn't ready for love
I was so up and down
In and out
Up and down
Left me on a ride going nowhere fast
Every girl I had
They might of had
What it takes
But I'm all alone

I was looking for love
Was looking for love
In Magic City
In the long run when you do it like that,
You're gonna be all alone
I was looking for love
Was looking for love
All the wrong places

I spent all my money on her,
Tonight I'm a be all alone
See I'm no fool
But I been dealt some really hard cards
But I'm used to losing
It's like a battle trying to get too my heart
But hears the way I look at it
It's gonna be someone for me
I'm gonna give my all
And now I'm gonna be easyyy and stay patient

I was looking for love
Was looking for love
In Magic City
In the long run when you do it like that,
Your gonna be all alone
I was looking for love
Was looking for love
All the wrong places
