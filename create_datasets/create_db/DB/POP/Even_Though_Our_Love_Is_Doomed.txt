I'm getting desperate
Desperate for a revolution
Some kind of spark
Some kind of connection
In these dangerous days
Come a little bit closer
I need to understand

Why we kill the things we love the most
Kill the things we love
Kill the things we love the most
Why we kill the things we love the most
Kill the things we love
Kill the things we love the most
But they don't burn like we do
They don't burn like we do

And even though our love is doomed
And even though we're all messed up
We're still waiting for tomorrow
We're still aching for tomorrow
And even though our love is cruel
And even though our stars are crossed
You're the only thing worth fighting for
You're the only thing worth dying for

Don't wanna be dead to life
Don't wanna be dulled to extinction
Don't wanna be lost in dreams
Don't wanna be caught sleepwalking
Maybe I should break the chain
Maybe I should break the connection
Such strange little birds
Devoured by our obsessions

Can you love me for what I've become
Love me for what I
Said that I would not become
Can you love me for what I've become
Love me for what I
Said that I would not become
'Cause they don't burn like I do
They don't burn like I do

And even though your love is cruel
And even though our stars are crossed
We're still waiting for tomorrow
We're still aching for tomorrow
And even though our love is doomed
And even though we're all messed up
You're the only thing worth fighting for
You're the only thing worth dying for

And even though our love is doomed
(Even though our love is doomed)
You're the only thing worth fighting for
You're the only thing worth dying for
