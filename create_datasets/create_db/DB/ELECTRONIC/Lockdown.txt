When I'm with you I feel so alive inside
My hearts emotions I can't describe
This energy between us so real it can't be denied
I want to know you more than I already do
Cause every time I find myself close to you
Electricity flows through me been shocked now set me free

I'll lock the groove down
(I'll lock the groove down)
Let me take you on and on
So we can move round
(I'll lock the groove down)
And we'll make it all night long

I'll lock the groove down
(I'll lock the groove down)
Let me take you on and on
So we can move round
(I'll lock the groove down)
And we'll make it all night long
(I'll take you on till the groove is gone)

When you touch me all my fears disappear
I want to be with you now
Can't you hear
In your eyes locked in time is right where I want to stay
Now I understand that it goes both ways
I want to hear you say it
Don't be afraid
We have so much more we don't know where this love could go

Oh what joy I'll bring, oh what joy I'll bring if you let me
Of this joy I sing of this joy I sing won't you let me

I'll lock the groove down
(I'll lock the groove down)
Let me take you on and on
(I'll take you on to the break of dawn)
So we can move round
(I'll lock the groove down)
And we'll make it all night long
(I'll take you on to grove is grove is)

I'll lock the groove down
(I'll lock the groove down)
Let me take you on and on
(I'll take you on to the break of dawn)
So we can move round
(I'll lock the groove down)
And we'll make it all night long
(I'll take you on to grove is gone)
I'll lock the grove down
