Open your world into everything

Subtle ripples forming closer
Touching me, I can't escape
Foolishly I think I'm stronger
Then a kiss, now it's too late

Fully ripened I am falling
Into your hands
For you to taste
I'm like a child, my eyes are open
Ambushed by your pretty face

Is it possible to love you
Or will this soon be washed away
By a single drop of water
In the desert I will lay
