I tell it to the moon
Scream it to the stars in the sky

Seeing you always reminds me
Got a secret that I keep
Got a keep it inside me
I watch from a distance
Loving you silently
You never hear me

So I tell it to the moon
Scream it to the stars in the sky
Share it with the wind
Try to keep it in
But it's so hard sometimes
So I yell it to the night
I don't know what else I can do
I can't tell it to you
So I tell it to the moon
Tell it to the moon

Late at night when no one can hear me
I reveal the way I feel pretending you're near me
You've got somebody
There's nothing I can do
Can't tell you I love you
So I ...

Tell it to the moon
Scream it to the stars in the sky
Share it with the wind
Try to keep it in
But it's so hard sometimes
So I yell it to the night
I don't know what else I can do
I can't tell it to you
So I tell it to the moon
Tell it to the moon

Some night
I'll come right out and tell you
Some night
I'll say the words I love you
Some night
But tonight
I'll tell it to the moon
