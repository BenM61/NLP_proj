Wait for all the broken pieces to fade
And lay your head upon my shoulder 'till you wake
And sleep through the stormy winter we'll escape
You know I will be here at the end of the day

You know you're never alone
When times are hard I'll hold you close
Let love heal you and I'll do the same
You know I will be here at the end of the day

Tears, falling down your cheek that can't be said
And fears, they're stealing from the selfness of your face
I will pray, we'll be turning corners out of this place
You know I will be here at the end of the day

You know you're never alone
When times are hard I'll hold you close
Let love heal you and I'll do the same
You know I will be here at the end of the day

The arms of love will pick you
Trap you up 'till you catch your breath
You catch your breath
Through the storm and reckless skies
Endless days and the sleepless nights
I'll be by your side

You know you're never alone
When times are hard I'll hold you close
Let love heal you and I'll do the same
You know I will be here at the end of the day
