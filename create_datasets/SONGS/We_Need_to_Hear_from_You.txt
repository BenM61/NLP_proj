We need to hear from you
We need a word from you
If we don't hear from you 
What will we do
Wanting you more each day
Show us your perfect way
There is no other way
That we can live

We need to hear from you
We need a word from you
If we don't hear from you 
What will we do
Wanting you more each day
Show us your perfect way
There is no other way
That we can live

Destruction is now is now in view
Seems the world has forgotten all about you
Children are crying and people are dying
They're lost without you, so lost without you
But you said if we seek 
Lord if we seek your face
And turn from our wicked, our wicked ways
You promised to heal our land 
Father you can

We need to hear from you
We need a word from you
If we don't hear from you 
What will we do
Wanting you more each day
Show us your perfect way
There is no other way
That we can live

We need to hear from you
We need a word from you
If we don't hear from you 
What will we do
Wanting you more each day
Show us your perfect way
There is no other way
That we can live

There is no other way
There is no other way
There is no other way
That we can live

Other way
There is no other way
There is no other way
That we can live
