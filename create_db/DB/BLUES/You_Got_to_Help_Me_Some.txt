Now you may be sweet little woman 
 As the apple on a tree 
 Don't want no woman to lay up 
 And depend on me 
 You got to help me some 
 Yes, you've got to help me some 
 Don't care what I do 
 Babe you've got to help me some 
 Now if I'm the Pullman porter, girl 
 You've got to be the maid 
 So when every Saturday come 
 We both can get paid 
 So you can help me some 
 Yes, I want you to help me some 
 I don't care what I do 
 Babe, you've got to help me some 
 Now when I go to bed little girl 
 And lay up beside-a you 
 Now if I shake the cover 
 Please try to shake it too 
 So you can help me some 
 Yes, I want you to help me some 
 And I don't care what I do 
 Babe you've got to help me some 
 Help me some little girl, help me some! 
 Now don't stand there and look at me like that 
 See'mon and help me some! 
 Now that's better, yes, yes, yes, yes 
 Now there's no such thing as man and wife 
 Now-a-day 
 We're just called partners 
 So you can knock yourself a slave 
 So you can help me some 
 Yes, I want you to help me some 
 I don't care what I do 
 Babe, you've got to help me some
