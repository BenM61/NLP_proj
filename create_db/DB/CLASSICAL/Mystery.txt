Danger, baby you're my savior
Soft night will fall, our guardian angel
I feel the mystery all in the air
That's why I always have to have you here

The mystery of you and me, night and day
The mystery of you and me, strange to say
I'll live a thousand lives for you
Each one right by your side, I do

Night falls, shadows on the ceiling
Hold me, I'm tied up to this feeling
I feel the mystery all in the air
That's why I always have to have you here

The mystery of you and me, night and day
The mystery of you and me, strange to say
I'll live a thousand lives for you
Each one right by your side, I do

I feel the mystery all in the air
Oh, I feel the mystery all in the air

The mystery of you and me, night and day
The mystery of you and me, strange to say
I'll live a thousand lives for you
Each one right by your side, I do
The mystery of you and me
