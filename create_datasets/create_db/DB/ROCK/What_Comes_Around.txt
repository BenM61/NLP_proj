What Comes Around

I hate you, I hate you - shut up...

You think that I'm the one to blame
Everything I lose is just a piece of what there is
To gain
You think it's cool and all is fine
Now is the day when you pay, this is my time
I feel for you nothing but pain
I am what you will be, you are dying in me
I love you, I hate you, I miss you...

You're always thinking you're so perfect
Those thoughts drove me away from home
But if you put me through your tests
Then I will fade

I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is wide open
Everything that is real
Comes around
Comes around...

Shut up...

Your stupid face just makes me sick
I see you changing every day
To fit into the newest clique
I know you, but everything you do
Is just a part of you, you'll never see the truth
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the way you think you're real
You one voice it destroys my one choice

You're always thinking you're so perfect
Those thoughts drove me away from home
But if you put me through your tests
Then I will fade

I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is wide open
Everything that is real
Comes around
Comes around...

Tu vida es mia
Your fear is living here in me

Es que no entiendo come en la vida puedes acer
La paz entre nostros cuando no vas a decir
why la gratitud que tu nunca vas a ver
Has now turned to hate

I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is wide open
Everything that is real
Comes around
Comes around...

Shut up!
