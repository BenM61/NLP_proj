War and slavery 
Exploitation 
The common basis of a Western nation 
Official version 
A falsified story 
The truth lies burried in a shroud of glory 
Influential people arn't serving time for being involved in organized crime 
But stashed away in beautiful mansions 
Guess who provides for their generous pensions?
Oppression
Ignorance
Censorship rule
Education is more that what's taught in school
Forced in a mold
Held down by threats
Decisions are made over our heads
But there is a way to refuse and resist
We don't need to be ruled with the iron fist
We are the people
We are strong
Let's make up our minds and prove 'em wrong
Religion and TV
We're under the thumb
Prone to believe 'cause we're already numb!
Black man
White man
Yellow man
Black man
White man
Rip the system
