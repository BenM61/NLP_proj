Is there a fire in the sky
Is there a moon up there
Is anything alive now
This darkness is what I hear
This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes

More than I can hold in my hand
Running through the gaps like water
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you

Is there a flame in the dark
Is there a bright heart star
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are
We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep whenever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all

Holding up an animal fear
Soaking up the waves underwater
Tuned to music no-one can hear
Forever in this half-light
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you

All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you

More than I can hold in my hand
Running through the gaps like water
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you

All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
Turning this night inside
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
