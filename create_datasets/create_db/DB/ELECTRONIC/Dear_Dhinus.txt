Dear Dhinus, did you call?
It was the best surprise of all
Don't need no crossroads or no scroll to sell your soul

Behind the writer of this song
Are a thousand love affairs gone wrong
You can only write when you're as lonely as a stone
(So you let the ones that you love go)

Oh how my heart keeps beating
I know it's just repeating
Feelings that were computed
Long ago while you were shooting high
I'm feeling like a butterfly
Who's gonna pluck my wings before I die?
Who's gonna pluck my wings before I die?

Tell the hangman not to start
And wake the hermit from your heart
Burn the maps that chart your dreams
They're all just make believe

Oh how my heart keeps beating
I know it's just repeating
Feelings that were computed
Long ago while you were shooting high
I'm feeling like a butterfly
Who's gonna pluck my wings before I die?
Who's gonna pluck my wings before I die?
