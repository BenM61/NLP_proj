Oh I just heard a melody and it almost made me cry
My voice was filled with yearning
But that's not all, there's something else
No that's not all, there's something else. 

Every word was in my ear and every note was crystal clear
Oh how you captured my heart
Oh how you captured my heart. 

You spoke to me with another tongue but I understood alright
Cause I believe in feeling
But that's not all, there's something else
No that's not all, there's something else. 

Every word was in my ear and every sound would just appear
Oh, how you captured my heart
Oh how you've gone and captured my heart
Oh how you captured my heart. 

That's not all, no that's not all, there's something else
No that's not all, that's not all, there's something else. 

You know that every word was in my ear and every note was crystal clear
Oh how you captured my heart
Oh how you've gone and captured my heart
Oh how you captured my heart
Oh how you've gone and captured my heart
Oh how you captured my heart
