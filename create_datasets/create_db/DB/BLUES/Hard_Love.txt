Shirley down the street she gets so lonesome
She calls around to men on the phone, some
Hopin' one will show up at her door
She don't care, just where they come from
Where they've been, just if they want some
Give it to her straight, she want to score
She needs hard love
Hard love
She wants a hard love, just to make her day
Handsome Bill sales cars for a livin'
He's not the takin' kind, he's the givin'
He likes his women real firm, and real tight
Bill don't want no conversations, 
Small talk or consultations
He don't want no long relation just one night
He needs a hard love 
He wants a hard love
He needs a hard love, to make his day
Chances are if you're feeling lonely
And you miss your one and only
You'll only care for that easy exercise
You know what I'm talkin' about
That no feeling in and out
You gonna have to improvise
If you want a hard love
You need a hard love
Hard love
