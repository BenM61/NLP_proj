And I was a boy from school 
Helplessly helping all the rules 
And there was a boy at school 
Hopelessly wrestling all his fools 
And there was a girl at school 
Blaming all the words she stole from home 
Nothing would keep her a child 
Long hours don't ? though we try 

We try but we don't have long 
We try but we don't belong 
We try but we didn't have long 
We try but we didn't belong 

Now I meet you on the street 
Helplessly breaking rules we meet 
Life's unfound ? and love's ?
Say goodbye to nothing everything caused 
Now I need you on my street 
Hopelessly breaking rules we meet 
Love's unfound ? and love's ?
Say goodbye to everything, nothing caused
