Spent my life inside this room
And disappeared some more each day
Spent my life inside this room
And disappeared some more each day

The screen stayed flashing in my mind
The screen stayed flashing in my mind 
The screen stayed flashing in my mind 
The screen stayed flashing in my mind 

Spent my life inside this room
And disappeared some more each day
Spent my life inside this room
And disappeared some more each day

I couldn't run away from you
You kept me hanging on the line
I couldn't run away from you
You kept me hanging on the line

I get so lonely all the time
I try to find my way back home

These streets will never look the same
My broken heart erased your name

The screen stayed flashing in my mind
The screen stayed flashing in my mind 
The screen stayed flashing in my mind 
The screen stayed flashing in my mind 

Spent my life inside this room
And disappeared some more each day

These streets will never look the same
My broken heart erased your name

The screen stayed flashing in my mind 
The screen stayed flashing in my mind 
The screen stayed flashing in my mind 
The screen stayed flashing in my mind
