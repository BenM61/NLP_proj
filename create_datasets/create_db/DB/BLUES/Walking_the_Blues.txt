Man slow down
We'll get there take your time don't walk so fast
Stay on your roller
I don't blame people
Saying "rocking the blues"
Walking the blues
'Cause man this is it
Now I think I'll relax
That's the way to relax

Now watch this
Boy is it hot today!
All you gotta do is put
One foot in the ?
And keep on walking
Walking the blues

That's what I call ?
I hope my old lady is home
When I get there
All this walking
I don't need my mother-in-law
I mean my wifemy mother-in-law
She's allways there
So we'll just keep walking on
