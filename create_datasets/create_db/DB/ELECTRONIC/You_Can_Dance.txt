In a discotheque at dawn
Is when it came to me
I'd been ravin' through the night
Lookin' for some company,
It was the Mambo talkin'
It's got a lot to say,
'Do you come here often?'
'Do you wanna play?'

The hitchhike into Paris
And zigzag by the Seine
The Hollywood moment
I'll never be the same

You can dance

There's a world awaiting
Way beyond the sea
How I love to travel
Baby will you come with me?

You can dance

Jump on the table
Slide down the pole
You can wear your sable
You can bare your soul

Through Reno down to Vegas
The casinos never close
To the movers and the shakers
The Tango never knows

You can dance
You can dance
You can dance
You can dance dance dance dance
You can dance dance dance dance

I need some inspiration

I've got a lot of time to lose

You can dance

And then the dolce vita
I find my beauty queen

In England there's a moment
One nation in a groove
You can dance
Where the music and emotion
Will make you wanna move

You can dance

Take me to the river
Try singing in the rain

You can dance

I like the jungle fever
It's got me in the mood again

You can dance

Oh tutti frutti 
Jones bar Hollywood

You can dance

I like Campari soda
I'd can can if I could

You can dance, you can dance
You can dance, you can dance
You can dance, you can dance
You can dance
