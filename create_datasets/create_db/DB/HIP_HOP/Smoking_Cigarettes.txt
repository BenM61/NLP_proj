Why oh why (why)
Gave you several years of my life
And it just ain't right
What's your perception of love
Now how many times did we say it was over
And how many times did we not leave
There's no sense in this love hangover
Please come back to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't forget your ways
I still remember our first kiss
You got me nervous and trembling
(smoking cigarettes at night)
Wondering where you've been
(smoking cigarettes at night)
I can't cope with this
(smoking cigarettes at night)
You're the one to help me quit
(smoking cigarettes at night)

In the midnight hour (late in the midnight hour)
I see the edge of your face
And it makes it hard for me to breathe
What can I do to change your decision
Please work with me (me, yeah)
Sometimes my eyes won't close from weeping
And sometimes I can't wake up from sleeping (why)
'cause you keep calling me, keep calling me
In my dreams

[Chorus]
I can't forget your ways
I still remember our first kiss
You got me nervous and trembling
(smoking cigarettes at night)
Wondering where you've been
(smoking cigarettes at night)
I can't cope with this
(smoking cigarettes at night)
You're the one to help me quit
(smoking cigarettes at night)

Newport, Winstons, Salems, Marlboro lights
Smoking out on you got me puffing out a pack a night
And I know it ain't healthy

[Chorus]
