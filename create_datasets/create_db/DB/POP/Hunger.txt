Hunger
It's a picture of the future long gone
Silence
Is a powerful defiance, truth be told
Desire
Like I'm walking on a wire I can't control

Let go, you call me home
Let go, let go

I've gotta stay awake, no I'm not afraid
Finally I get to see the light breaking though the cracks
And even though I know it gets harder and harder
To live like the wind's at your back

There is gold but there is no man

Violence
Tell me where I look for guidance, I don't know
Disaster
I'm still looking for an answer on control

Let go, you call me home
Let go, let go

I've gotta stay awake, no I'm not afraid
Finally I get to see the light breaking though the cracks
And even though I know it gets harder and harder
To live like the wind's at your back

I've gotta stay awake, no I'm not afraid
Finally I get to see the light breaking though the cracks
And even though I know it gets harder and harder
To live like the wind's at your back

There is gold but there is no man

We're falling slowly through thin air
But my love, there is no ground
So don't be scared

I've gotta stay awake, no I'm not afraid
Finally I get to see the light breaking though the cracks
Even though I know it gets harder and harder
To live like the wind's at your back

I've gotta stay awake, no I'm not afraid
Finally I get to see the light breaking though the cracks
Even though I know it gets harder and harder
To live like the wind's at your back
To see light between the cracks

There is gold but there is no man
