Train whistle blowin'
Makes a sleepy noise
Underneath the blankets
For all the girls and boys

Rockin' rollin' ridin'
Out along the bay
All bound for Morningtown
Many miles away

Driver at the engine
Fireman rings the bell
Sandman swings the lantern 
To show that all is well

Rockin' rollin' ridin'
Out along the bay
All bound for Morningtown
Many miles away

Maybe it is raining
Where our train will ride
All the little travellers
Are warm and snug inside

Rocking, rolling, riding
Out along the bay
All bound for Morningtown
Many miles away

Somewhere there is sunshine
Somewhere there is day
Somewhere there is Morningtown
Many miles away

Rocking, rolling, riding
Out along the bay
All bound for Morningtown
Many miles away

Rocking, rolling, riding
Out along the bay
All bound for Morningtown
Many miles away
