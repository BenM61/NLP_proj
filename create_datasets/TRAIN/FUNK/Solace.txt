Farewell to the west now 
And welcome, to the east 
Farewell to the one who raked, the sand beneath my feet 
Thank you for the space we shared, and the heart and soul my friend 
I will see you through the colours, between the mountains as the sun decends 

Oh we twisted and we reflected upon a grin 
Common ground we walked upon, with common feelings &amp; common things 
Yes it is a cruel world, but there is solace amongst the sin 
Peace to you for now we'll share again, we'll share again 

Farewell to the west now 
My mind is open to the east 
To all the new faces, new minds &amp; things to see 
I am alone here, and my heart at times it weeps 
You will see me through the colours, as the sun sinks in the sea 

Oh we twisted and we reflected upon a grin 
Common ground we walked upon, with common feelings &amp; common things 
Yes it is a cruel world, but there is solace amongst the sin 
Peace to you for now we'll share again, we'll share again 

Oh we twisted and we reflected upon a grin 
Common ground we walked upon, with common feelings &amp; common things 
Yes it is a cruel world, but there is solace amongst the sin 
Peace to you for now we'll share again, we'll share again 
We will share again 
We'll share again 
Hmmm, hmmm, oh my friend we'll share again 
Oh we will share again
