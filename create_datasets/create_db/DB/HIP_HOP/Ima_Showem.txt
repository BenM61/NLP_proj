Show 'em you the illest
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
How they gonna feel it?
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em

I'ma flowin' with my poem
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
Show 'em you the realest
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em

My equilibrium is slightly off
I'm a little bit tilted off the loudmouths
In hip hop who claim the built it
Hip hop is a God inspired art form
Correction's my delivery giving proper credit
With no edit to the chivalry

Straight laced straight faced
You can buck it if you want to
Undermining cleverly your twisted schemes
The factors on to bigger and better things

Future shining
Amazing as a ray of light to somebody trapped
In a cave since they freed the slaves
I'm bursting at the seams for a chance to gleam
I'ma show 'em,  I'ma show 'em

I mean it's like this wit; it's simply put
My plagiarism wisdom used in decision making process
Helps me make the kind of choices
I can live with swallow and digest

I rise up like emotions and feelings
Dust in the cracks of ceilings
Healing in the name of Jesus all the achy parts
Landscaping mentally shaking

Unusual fellow
The album's three times dope
Don't hope it's going to be mellow
I'm coming with the force of a county sheriff

Serving subpoenas to a ballooned buffoon
Barbaric with his platoon
Goon squadron
And soon this gone be released
And like Jesus we bring swords not peace
To say the least
I'ma show' 'em, I'ma show 'em

Ya'll can watch the way I throw 'em
Take what I instilled up in my poem
I'ma gonna go in like a surgeon
Urgin' ya'll to cease with all the splurgin'
Hit me on my pager
This is major, this is major

Show 'em you the illest
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
How they gonna feel it?
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
I'ma flowin' with my poem

I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
Show 'em you the realest
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em

Show 'em you the illest
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
How they gonna feel it?
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em

I'ma flowin' with my poem
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
Show 'em you the realest
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em

From the middle of the dirty rhyme
Excursion 'cause diversion
Splurging nouns and verbs converted
Phrases phrases from my pages
Ballers call us verbal players

Crumbs to bricks we flip to layers
Stack to cake and serve in prayer
Hopes and dreams we must believe
Dope emcees from birth are these

No need for paper chasing cheese
Blessed with riches heavenly
Daily hate is breedin' jealousy
Using my lifestyle as an album concept

But soon enough the truth reveals
The lies you claim in your rep
'Cause we the realest not in the sense
Of claiming hardest on wax
What you see is what you get

We only hard on them facts
Best believe we the illest
'Cause you bouncing to beat created an illustrated
By some c Christian emcee

My style is universal
School of rhyme university instituting my profession
With lessons through diversity
Could never be pinpointed by beats

'Cause beats could never define one
Who's anointed in speech and likewise spiritually
Through intervention words capture me and rapture me
Minds of blinded individuals close minded
Residuals don't make you and emcee

Just because your budgets big
And your video looks Hollywood
Don't make you better than me
Time is ticking, people changing
Taste the real from fake appeal

I'm from the 'ville
I thought you knew we was titans
Don't clash with Nash
Not on a mission to prove but was commissioned to move
Not for flashy style or Image but because God said it was finished

Show 'em you the illest
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
How they gonna feel it?
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em

I'ma flowin' with my poem
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
Show 'em you the realest
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em

Show 'em you the illest
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
How they gonna feel it?
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em

I'ma flowin' with my poem
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
Show 'em you the realest
I'ma show 'em, I'ma show 'em
