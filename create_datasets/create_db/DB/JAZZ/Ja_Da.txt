You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
 
Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
