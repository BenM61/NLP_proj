I get it every day
I'm getting used to it
Now every time it hits
My heart quits
I wear a little smile
While swallowing the dirt
But underneath my shirt
My heart hurts

It's murder but it's nice
Getting away with it
The time you let it slip
I liked it
My fingers and my thumbs
Overcome me with mirth
But underneath my shirt
My heart hurts

Lord, if you're lonely
You Must be out of your mind
Lord, if you're lonely
You must be out of your mi--I--I--ind

I get it every day
I'm getting used to it
Now every time it hits
My heart quits
Your taste is for the task
Your fondness is to flirt
But underneath my shirt
My heart hurts

Lord, if you're lonely
You Must be out of your mind
Lord, if you're lonely
You must be out of your mi--I--I--ind

I get it every day
I'm getting used to it
Now every time it hits
My heart quits
I wear a little smile
While swallowing the dirt
But underneath my shirt
My heart hurts
