Wasn't that me
In the lead tonight
Still a little behind
But I'll be alright

Ridin' down hard
Who do you think you are
In the lead tonight

I'm livin' with the hurt
I wrecked a thirty dollar shirt
It's the rule of the west
When you ride with the best
You can live with the hurt

I ride everything
They put under me
Ride real good
In bad company
Don't feel no pain
For I will regain the lead tonight

I'm livin' with the hurt
I wrecked a thirty dollar shirt
It's the rule of the west
When you ride with the best
You can live with the hurt

It's been one for the cowboys
And three for the bulls
Anyway I see it
I got my hands full
Don't feel the pain
Just a step away from the lead tonight
