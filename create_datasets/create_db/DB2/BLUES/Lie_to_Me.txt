Lie to me baby
Uh huh
Lie to me baby
Lie to me baby
Lie to me baby
Move on

I know you got another jockey at home
Let me be your rider
Till your real man comes
Whip me baby
Lie like a dog
I really don't care
If you do

Lie to me baby
Uh huh
Lie to me baby
Lie to me baby
Lie to me baby
Move on

I know you got yourself a skinny old man
Let me be your baby
I know that I can
Slap me baby
Give me all of your grief
I have no use for the truth
Lie to me baby
Move on

I know you got another jockey at home
Let me be your rider
Till your real man comes
Whip me baby
Lie like a dog
I really don't care
If you do
Never stop telling me lies

Lie to me baby
Move on
