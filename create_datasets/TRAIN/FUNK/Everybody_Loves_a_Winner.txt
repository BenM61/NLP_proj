Once I had fame
Oh I was full of pride
Had lots of friends
Always here right by my side
Well my fame oh it died
Now my friends all try to hide

Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone

Everywhere I turned
There was a hello and smile
I never thought
They'd be gone after a while
Well my friends let me down
And the smiles turned to frowns

Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone

Once I had love
Ah but I couldn't be true
To get back that love
There ain't nothing I wouldn't do
Well I've loved
And I've lost
And now I'll pay the cost

Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone
