Die! die! die! die!
Scum sucking depravity debauched!
Anal f*ck-fest, thrill olympics
Savage scourge supply and sanctify
So what? so what?
Die! die! die! die!

Die! die! die! die!
You said it!
Sedatives supplied become laxatives
My eyes shit out lies
I only kill to know I'm alive
So what? so what?
Die! die! die! die!

Die! die! die! die!
So what, it's your problem to learn to live with
Destroy us, or make us saints
We don't care, it's not our fault that we were born too late
A screaming headache on the brow of the state
Killing time is appropriate
To make a mess and f*ck all the rest, we say, we say
So what? so what?
Die! die! die! die!

Die!
Now I know what is right
I'll kill them all if I like
I'm a time bomb inside
No one listens to reason,
It's too late and I'm ready to fight!
So what? now I'm ready to fight!
