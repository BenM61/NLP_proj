My man, your plans
Backfired when you least expected them to
My man, your plans
Backfired now that I'm rejecting you
My love, your kiss
No longer seems to be to satisfy
My love, my tears
I can't cry a river 'cause the well has run dry

(Backfired) I'll no longer play the fool
(Backfired) I'll no longer take your abuse
(Backfired) You said baby we are through
(Backfired) I don't need your bad news
Oh, oh your bad news, oh oh

My man, your games
Backfired at you when you broke all the rules
You played yourself
That now my love is coming back to you, oh
Go lie somewhere else
I don't ned ya knocking at my door, oh
Stay by yourself
I don't need ya, I can't take no more

(Backfired) I'll no longer play the fool
(Backfired) I'll no longer take your abuse
(Backfired) You said baby we are through
(Backfired) I don't need your bad news, no no
(Backfired)

I'll no longer play the fool (Backfired)
I'll no longer take your abuse (Backfired)
You said baby we are through (Backfired)
'Cause I don't need you

I could have gave you lovin' just like you wanted
But you'll never do right by me
(Never do right by me)
Instead you felt the need to hang on and pretend
So now I've gotta set you free

I claim the victory
It backfired, yes it did
You know it backfired, oh oh
Gave you lovin' just like you wanted me to
I could have gave you lovin' just like you wanted
But you'll never do right by me  (Never do right by me)
Instead you felt the need to hang on and pretend
So now I've gotta set you free!  (Set you free!)

I claim the victory (Backfired)
