The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear
Are still inside my head
The kindest words I'll ever know
Are waiting to be said
The most entrancing sight of all
Is yet for me to see
And the dearest love in all the world
Is waiting somewhere for me
Is waiting somewhere, somewhere for me

The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear
Are still inside my head
The kindest words I'll ever know
Are waiting to be said

The most entrancing sight of all
Is yet for me to see
And the dearest love in all the world
Is waiting somewhere for me
Is waiting somewhere, somewhere for me

The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear

The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear
Are still inside my head

The kindest words I'll ever hear

The kindest words I'll ever hear
Are waiting to be said

The most entrancing sight of all
Is yet for me to see

The most entrancing sight of all
Is yet for me to see

And the dearest love in all the world

Is waiting somewhere for me

Waiting somewhere

Is waiting somewhere
