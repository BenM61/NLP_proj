Like a believer 
We are out to find 

Like a believer 
We are living our minds 

Like a believer 
We don't waste any time 

Like a believer 
We stand our ground 

I just can't understand this 
Why it's so hard 
To take each other by the hand and 
And say that I love you 

Like a believer 
We can't let this go 

NO MORE WAR, NO MORE WAR, NO MORE WAR

Just say that I love you 

This world is in trouble 
We got to find a way 

To come together 
And make a better way 

I can't understand this 
No 

Troubled the world 
There's no time for children 
And their hearts 

Just look at their eyes 
Can't you see you're tearing 
Them apart 

So I ask you believe us 
Don't waste any time 

Let's stay together and 
Save our world 

I just can't understand this 
Why it's so hard 
To take each other by the hand and 
And say that I love you 

Like a believer 
We can't let this go 

NO MORE WAR, NO MORE WAR, NO MORE WAR

Just say that I love you 

This World is in trouble
We got to find the Way
