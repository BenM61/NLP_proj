I can't believe you chose someone like me
When I've done nothing to deserve it, no
I feel so blessed 'cause you give me
You best
Your love is nothing less than incredible

I'll take a little time out
Just to think a little while
Back on everything 
I've been through
All my ups 'n' downs
Would still be ups 'n' downs if
If it wasn't for you

I can't believe you chose someone like me
When I've done nothing to deserve it, no
I feel so blessed 'cause you give me
You best
Your love is nothing less than incredible

I tried it without you
Can't do it without you
Never again will I try
You came and you love me
And oh how you loved me
Somehow I just don't know why

Lord you mean just
The whole world to me
Without you
I don't know
Where I would be

I can't believe you chose someone like me
When I've done nothing to deserve it, no
I feel so blessed 'cause you give me
You best
Your love is nothing less than incredible
