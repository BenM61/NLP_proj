The day will come, you cannot run
White hot clouds fill the sky
See the red flare, blasting hot air
There's no place left to hide

Binding our eyes as the sun turns to black
A world full of hatred and fear
All are committed, there's no going back
There'll be no one left to hear

Shock, there's no relief
Shock, no will ever know why
Shock

Shock, panic won't cease
Shock, time to say our last good-bye
Shock

Aftershock, humanity's loss
Aftershock, all is destroyed
Aftershock, have no remorse
Aftershock, into the void

Never again we cannot depend
On leaders who see things so blind
Time will not lend, and never amend
A lesson for all mankind
