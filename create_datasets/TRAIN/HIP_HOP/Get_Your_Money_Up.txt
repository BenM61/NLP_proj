(stop, now let me see your booty drop)

(Keri Hilson)
If you think your impressin' us with your ice and dub poppin' bottles in the club, 
Get your money up.
Cause I ain't your average girl, 
I've been all around the world
With your boy around me,
Get your money up
Get your money up boy
Get your money up,
I wonna see something bigger than a Hummer truck
Get your money up boy
Get your money up, you gotta throw something bigger than a hundred bucks.

Now slide slide one of them black cars if you got it then show me how your gettin' it.
Diamonds a girls best friend, you can provide them, 
Might even have to fool while your hittin' it.
When you see me in my days blow a whole lot of change, 
Tell your boy don't get jealous, get your money up
And if you don't like us, there's nothing to discuss, 
We don't even give a f*ck get your money up

Get your money up
Get your money up
Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up
Get your money up
Get your money up

Stop, now let me see your booty drop!
(get em Keysh')

(Keyshia Cole)
If your tearin' the bar down with all the fly woman and still livin' with your momma, 
Get your money up
Ridin' big whips, can take care of your kids, 
Why you lookin' at me? get your money up
When I'm up in the club, you know how we roll, 
Them bottles pop, nonstop
Up in Hollywood, you know how we roll, stop! 
Now let me see your booty drop

(Keri Hilson)
Get your what I'm talkin' about I don't wanna hear your mouth, 
You need to put some money down, or get your money up
Why you invadin' my space? why you get up in my face?
I ain't got nothing to say but get your money up
Get your money up boy
Get your money up
I wanna see something better than all of us
Get your money up boy
Get your money up
You know my bottle cost more than a hundred bucks
Get your money up
Get your money up
(stop playin' with yourself)
Get your money up
Get your money up
Get your money up
(stop, now let me see your booty drop)

Ok now slide slide one of them black cars, 
If you got it then show me how your getting it
Diamonds a girls best friend, if you can provide them, 
I might even have to fool while your hittin' it.
Now grind grind get yourself some big money and don't forget about me when your spittin' it
But if you ain't gon' pay don't be screamin' out "hey girl"
(wait, now let me see your booty drop)

(Trina)
Now slide slide one of them black cars make the pacific ocean be part of my backyard
If you ain't gon' pay don't be screamin' out hey
I'm an independent honey, I get money all day
Now slide to your bank account, all the cash throw it out
If you ain't yellin' diamonds and dollars, I gotta walk it out
Know what I'm talkin' about? you steppin' to the baddest
Got millionaires standin' in line wishin' they had this
Take me to Paris, buy 100 carrots, Christian Loubouton boots, bags and more carrots
You on average, or at least the wrong section my girl need some checks so he headin' in our direction

Get your money up
Get your money up
(stop playing with yourself)
Get your money up
Get your money up
Get your money up
(stop, now let me see your booty drop)

(I know that's right Keri, your girl KC, Trina, they gon' hate on this one right here
Now get your money up.
Get your money up
We don't like them broke boys we don't like them broke boys.)
