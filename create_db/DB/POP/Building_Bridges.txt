If I could plant a tree for every time
I used to hear you say
Life runs through your hands like water
Our backyard would be a forest now
Sometimes I feel like I am running out of time
Just like you did everything I do reminds me of you

If I had a cent for every place
We never got to go
Between Africa and our house
Maybe I would be a billionaire
Sometimes I feel like I am running out of time
Just like you did everything I do reminds me of you

If I had a brick for every word
That we forgot to say
Everything you never told me
Maybe I'd be building bridges now
Sometimes I feel like I am running out of time
Because you did everything I do
Sometimes I feel like everything I do reminds me of you
Everything I do reminds me of you
