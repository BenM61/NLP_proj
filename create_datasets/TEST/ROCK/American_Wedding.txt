Have you ever been to American wedding?
Where is the vodka, where is marinated herring?
Where is the musicians that got the taste?
Where's the supply that's gonna last three days?
Where's the band that like fanfare? Gonna keep it going 24 hour

Instead it's 1 in the morning and DJ's patching up the chords
Everybody's full of cake, staring at the floor
Proper couples start to mumble that it's time to go
People gotta get up early and they gotta go

Ah, people gotta get up early and she's got a boyfriend
And this whole fucking thing is one huge disappointment
And nothing gets these bitches going, not even gypsy kings
Nobody talks about my super theory of super everything

So be Donald Trump or be an anarchist
Make sure that your wedding doesn't end up like this

I understand the cultures of a different kind
But here word celebration just doesn't come to mind

Have you ever been to American wedding?
Where is the vodka, where is marinated herring?
Where is the musicians that got the taste?
Where's the supply that's gonna last three days?
Where's the band that like fanfare? Gonna keep it going 24 hour
