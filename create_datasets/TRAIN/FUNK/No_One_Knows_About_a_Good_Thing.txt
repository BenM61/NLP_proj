I know you know he's getting over
The rumors say he's fooling around
Your face sadly pressed upon my shoulder
Too bad to hear, he's putting you down

'cause no one knows about a good thing
Until a good thing is gone
Remember when you loved a good thing
To lose one is just no fun

No one knows about a sweet thing
Until the sweet thing is gone
Baby, dry your eyes, you don't have to cry

You know I love you, love you so madly, oh yeah
Again you've been pushed
Pushed off to the curdle, oh yeah
I begged to take you, I've held you so gladly
Just give me some sign, baby say the word

'cause no one knows about a good thing
Until the good thing is gone
Remember when you loved a good thing
To lose one is just no fun

No one knows about a sweet thing
Until the sweet thing is gone
Baby dry your eyes, you don't have to cry

I guess no one knows what you've really been living at
It's funny like that
I don't wanna complete that
I just wanna, I just wanna

Don't mean to push, but my love's in a hurry, yes baby
I'm standing here like I'm gonna die
I must admit you've got me so worried
I just want for us to give it a try, give it a try

'cause no one knows about a good thing
Until the good thing is gone
Remember when you loved a good thing
To lose one is just no fun

No one knows about a sweet thing
Until the sweet thing is gone
Baby dry your eyes, you don't have to cry

No one knows about a good thing
Remember when you loved a good thing
To lose one is just no fun

No one knows about a sweet thing
Until the sweet thing is gone
Baby dry your eyes, you don't have to cry

Don't cry baby, don't cry baby
Don't cry baby, sweet baby

No one knows about a sweet thing
Until the sweet thing is gone
