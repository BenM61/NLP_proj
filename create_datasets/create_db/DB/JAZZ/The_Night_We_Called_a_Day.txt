There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over it's face
You kissed me and went on your way
The height we called it a day

I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament In my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

Soft through the the dark
A hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No sadder was he than I

The moon went down stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day
