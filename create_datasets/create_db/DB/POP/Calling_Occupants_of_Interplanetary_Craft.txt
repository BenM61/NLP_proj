Hey, babe, what would you like to hear?
We've been observing your Earth
Hey babe, I'm sorry, I can't hear you too well 
You're gonna have to speak a little closer into the phone
Okay, babe? What would you like to hear again?
We are observing your Earth

And we'd like to make
I'm sorry Mike, we there's-
A contact (uh)
With you, baby

In your mind you have capacities, you know
To telepath messages through the vast unknown
Please close your eyes and concentrate
With every thought you think
Upon the recitation we're about to sing

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary, most extraordinary craft

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary, most extraordinary craft

You've been observing our Earth
And we'd like to make
A contact with you

We are your friends

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary, ultra emissaries

We've been observing your Earth
And one night we'll make
A contact with you

We are your friends

Calling occupants of interplanetary, quite extraordinary craft

And please come in peace, we beseech you
Only our love we will teach them
Our Earth may never survive
So do come, we beg you

Please, interstellar policeman
Oh won't you give us a sign
Give us a sign
That we've reached you
Oh do

With your mind you have ability to form
And transmit thought energy far beyond the norm
You close your eyes, you concentrate
Together, that's the way
To send the message we declare World Contact Day

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft
Calling occupants of interplanetary, most extraordinary craft

Calling occupants
Calling occupants of interplanetary, anti-adversary craft
