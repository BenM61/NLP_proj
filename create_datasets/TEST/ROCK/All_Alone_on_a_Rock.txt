All alone on a rock
Colder than the constellations 
Fired free of gravitations hollow
The mathematic suns 
Sing to me what must be done 
And anything is possible tomorrow 
All alone on a rock 
Far below the city's rolling 
Colder than the ocean in it's shadow 
I do not feel pain 
I won't be going back again
And anything is possible tomorrow 
Every shipwreck lying hollow
Every burned and broken cello
In it's far magellic dust 
Is callin' back for me to follow 
And I'm
All alone on a rock 
Hanging in the solar gale 
Sweeping down the fields of Galileo 
The mathematic suns
Sing to me what must be done
They sing to me and sing as one 
They're moving now it has begun
And anything is possible tomorrow 
I do not feel pain
I won't be back this way again 
And anything is possible tomorrow
