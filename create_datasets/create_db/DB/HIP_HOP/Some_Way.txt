Yeah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah, yeah

If I'mma talk, I'mma talk, I'mma keep it real
Me and my boys, and my boys, we will split a pill
Noodles and pots in a pot was a nigga meal
Now that we on, that we on, we gon' split a mill
I take a jet, take a jet when I'm overseas
None of my girls, of my girls gon' get over me
Shout out to Hawk, shoutout Dooly, shoutout Hennessy
Them be my bros, be my bros 'till the death of me
Nobody know, -body know how I really be
I got some bars for a nigga if he wanna see
Dress up your talk if a nigga wanna talk to me
F*ck your phone calls, I don't want apologies
Everyone said, yeah they said I was gonna peak
Most number ones, number ones in a nigga league
I think your girl, think your girl, fell in love with me
She say my f*ck and my tongue game a remedy

Oh yeah, yeah, I just hit a lick and I know you feelin' some way
(Nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah)
I just took that chick, and I know you feelin' some way, oh yeah
She just want a nigga like me, you feelin' some way, way, way, yeah
She just want a nigga like me, I play no

Way, we got 'em feelin' some way
Way, 'cause you see XO in the place, told her wait
I gotta get myself together
Yesterday, I spent two thousand on a sweater, way
I think the belts inside the store look better on my waist
I think my nuts look better on her face
This bitch got addicted, all she do was take a taste
Now you gettin' mad because you got replaced
The brown boy and the Starboy on a track (yeah)
Haters gonna say this shit is wack
I went to the Hills straight from the trap
I'mma f*ck your bitch and give her back
She said she pop pills I told her stop it
Check my little pocket I got options
I'm the first brown boy to get it poppin'
If I say the words, my shooters gonna pop 'em

Oh yeah, yeah, I just hit a lick and I know you feelin' some way
(Nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah)
I just took that chick, and I know you feelin' some way, oh yeah
She just want a nigga like me, you feelin' some way, way, way
She just want a nigga like me, I play no games
