Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?
Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?

Just like the wind finds a resting place
Somewhere in the bosom of the land
Sowing his rich by the hands of the wise
And peace should come to every man
Just when he thinks he can lay down and roll
He's seen the place he's looking for coming up the road

Oh, is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?
Always one more bridge
Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?

Now I don't wanna sing that same old song
I want a new tune that we can all sing along
We made new maps, but we didn't change the signs
Still say "This is yours and this over here is mine"
Like a little ol' man sitting on a bench
He says he rides for freedom, but he can't cross the fence
Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?

Oh, oh, oh one more
They say I got one more
Oh, when you get up over here, you'll find one more
When you get around the bend, you see one more
Almost made it, one more
You're so, so close
Come more, but you're almost made it
You think you made it, made it at last
Just take a look and you'll see 99 and a half

Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?
Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?

Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?
Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?
