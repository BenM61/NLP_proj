I really wanted to go
It hurt me too much to stay
I run away so fast
That my heart couldn't find a way
And then you came along
And I was tired of my sadness
It seemed as though my life went on
But the feeling didn't last

[Chorus:]
And then you came along
And then it's gone
Saving my life from going on (lost and found)
Thinking of what else you could have done
It wasn't meant to be (lost and found)
Holding on to everything that's gone
Saving my life from going on (lost and found)
Thinking of what else you could have done
It wasn't meant to be (lost and found)

I was back on my feet
You could say I was barely walking
But the cut was deep
And I was holding on to the past

[Chorus]

He had stolen my illusions
And I needed them so badly
I grew tired of my confusion
'Cause he was still there
Everywhere (everywhere)

You came along, and I was lost and found (lost and found)
Lost and found, my life went on, but I was lost and found
You came along when I was stuck in the past
There was a new life in sight
But I was blind

[Chorus x 2]

It wasn't meant to be
