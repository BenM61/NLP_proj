You're there for me, through all of my ups and downs
And what I feel you always seem to know
You find the words when I need comforting
And dry my eyes, that's why I love you so

More than a friend you're my first love
I can always depend on my first love

I feel like I have known you all my life
I can't explain how close we are
When something's wrong, you know how to make it right
That's why you stay close to my heart

More than a friend you're my first love
I can always depend on my first love

The first thought in my mind, the chill up my spine
The melody in my heart, you are my very first love
You're the sweet lullaby, my first kiss goodnight
The beat in my heart, music, my very first love

More than a friend you're my first love
I can always depend on my first love

With you in my life I'm not lonely at all
And if there were tears you'd catch them all
'Cause you know my pain and you know my joy
There's no secrets between us only pretty piano chords

The first thought in my mind, the chill up my spine
The melody in my heart, music, my very first love
You're the sweet lullaby, my first kiss goodnight
The beat in my heart, music, my very first love

I sing, I sing because I'm happy
The music sets me free
You're the sweet lullaby, my first kiss goodnight
The beat in my heart, music, my very first love
