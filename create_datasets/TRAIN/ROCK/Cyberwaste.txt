Nothing you say matters to us
Nothing you say matters to us
F*ck you

Spread your word this point of you
And connect the machine
God damned words, ocean of lies
Taunting you to deceive

Nothing you say matters to us
Nothing you say matters to us
You are a virus spreading disease
Your life is so sad spreading lies of hate

Nothing you say matters to us
Nothing you say matters to us
F*ck you

So you'll seize up in your lies you
Tell up at the site
Sees you, signals and hate me to stand
Me with your lies

You are a virus spreading disease
Your life is so sad spreading lies of hate

Reap what you sow
Your words are shit

You are a virus spreading disease
Your life is so sad spreading lies of hate

Awesome that you know my thoughts
(All I want to do is see)
Made back screen with your disease
(Tapping only on the keys)

Change your face in front of me
(Safe behind the cyberscreen)
Wishing that you knew the truth
(All I know is what I read)

Nothing you say matters to us
