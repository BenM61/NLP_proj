Words that were spoken in the anger
Of youth only half truth.
Touched by the chilbride
While
Deep inside her lie real truth.
He was the passion of the spring

He was the baby.
And half forgotten in the passing
Of time.
The real crime brother and brother
With backs to each other
The war sign.
And in the passion of the spring
Came the baby.

Come back
Mama
Mama sing him a song.
Tell him all that was wrong

Tell him all that you had that was bad.
Tell him all that was good mama.
You know that you should mama

Remember the good mama.
And with the light that you show
Let him grow
Let him go
Let him go

Let him go
Let him
Let him
Let him go.
Words that were spoken in the anger
Of youth only half truth.

Touched by the chilbride
While
Deep inside her lie the real truth.
He was the passion of spring

He was the baby.
He was the passion of the spring

He was the baby.
And in the passion of the spring 
Came the baby. 
And in the passion of the spring 
Came the baby.

The baby yeah
The baby yeah.
