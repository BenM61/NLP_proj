They tried to catch a falling star. 
Thinking that she had gone too far. 
She did but kept it hidden well. 
Until she cracked and then she fell. 

If all the history is true. 
She's gonna end up just like you. 
You made it to the other side. 
But tell me who will be my guide. 

They build you up so they can tear you down. 
Trust the ocean you'll never drown. 
Who is next? Who's gonna steal your crown? 
You'll see. 

I have learnt my lesson well. 
The truth is out there I can tell. 
Don't look back and don't give in to their lies and goodbyes. 
Northern Star. 

Fulfil the longing in your heart. 
Then we will never be apart. 
And if they dare to question you. 
Just tell them that our love is true. 

They buy your dreams so they can sell your soul. 
Is it any wonder we've lost control? 
Feelings come, feelings go. 

I have learnt my lesson well. 
The truth is out there I can tell. 
Don't look back and don't succumb to their lies and goodbyes. 
Live your life without regret. 
Don't be someone who they forget. 
When you're lost reach out for me. 
And you'll see she's not far. 
Northern Star. 
Northern Star.
