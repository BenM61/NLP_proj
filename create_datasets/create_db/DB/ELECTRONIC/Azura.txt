Here's all I really know of this life
Love's all we have to give
Seems like the more I struggle on this earth
The more completely I'm in
In a world where mediocrity rules
Bodies collide without a moment of emotion
Scant parts running high behind closed minds
And we all lose our way
Let me be, let me be the moon and stars for you
Let me be your sky of blue
Let me be, let me be the sun and moon for you
Let me be your sky of blue
The winter clouds are stalking up on me
Packing the sun away
Darkness is creeping up on all our dreams
To wipe them clean away
Building boxes around our lives
Compartments for each and every feeling
Freedom lost with our innocence
Forgotten long ago.
Let me be, let me be the moon and stars for you
Let me be your sky of blue
Let me be, let me be the sun and moon for you
Let me be your sky of blue
Your sky of blue.
That's all I really know of this life
Here's what I want to be
Seems like the more I wander on this earth
The more I'm after me
In a world where freedom rules
Souls cut the line and make the sweetest music
One part's necessary in open minds
And we won't lose our way
