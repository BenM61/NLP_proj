Louise,
Its been a long time I know,
Louise,
Ill always remember your name.

I crawled on my knees,
Begging you to stay,
You make me shiver me Louise,
You make me quiver.

I do the strangest things,
I think such lonely thoughts,
Forgetting all,
Been Forgetting You,
Louise

Anything at all,
Not to think of you,
Anything at all,
Damn these eyes you took,
Louise.

I feel I'm getting weaker,
A life full on lonely ways,
I feel I'm diving deeper,
Into the darkest scapes,
There's nothing at all,
To find the way.

Louise, Louise,
Louise,
My heart used to beat,
Now it only weeps,
Louise, Louise,
Louise,
Uncared the city sleeps,
I'm twisted in the streets.

And I shiver,
I quiver,
In to these strangest things,
Lonely thoughts,
Forgetting you Louise,
And you promised me,
You promised me,
You'd solve the antilius(splodge),
Louise,
Louise,
Leave me here,
Leave me here,
No longer meant to be here,
Louise,
Louise.
