I remember travelling by your side
I was your disciple and you were my guide
Now the choice is made and the wrong is done
and I will meet you next year in Zion
Next year in Zion

And I remember the drugs we did
I was drinking opium and you were smoking weed
There are healthier things I now get high on
And I will meet you next year in Zion
Next year in Zion

I have no home and I have no house
and I am quiet like a mouse
but I can fight like a giant
and I will meet you next year in Zion 
Next year in Zion

Now no one has a thousand friends
and something starts where another ends
I was wrong when I said you were the one I could rely on
and I will meet you next year in Zion
Next year in Zion

Now drink your wine and drink your beer
And kindle your candle on the chandelier
It looks like gold but it's made of iron
I will meet you next year in Zion
Next year in Zion

I have no home and I have no house
and I am quiet like a mouse
but I can fight like a giant
and I will meet you next year in Zion
Next year in Zion

I have no home and I have no house
and I am quiet like a mouse
but I can roar like a lion
and I will meet you next year in Zion
I will meet you next year in Zion
I will meet you-
