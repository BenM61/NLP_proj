Fire's coming down, hot winds blow the smoke away
Low screams of the survivors the innocent have paid
Nobody knows what happened, light was all they've seen
People walk through the destruction of the enemy
Molten bodies become more and more,
No chance to be saved
Helpless children seek for their parents
But they're into the grave

After the attack empty souls tormented brains
After the attack deformed mutants psychical confusion
After the attack nuclear winter in the land
After the attack will this ever end

Everywhere starts the search for water and groceries
Hate rules the land you get nothing if you please
Fear is controlling all actions kill to survive
The scarlet sky is the witness of all as the mutants arrive
Between ruins rotting corpses lie the smell of burning bones
All hope is in vain as death is creeping through the stones

The only way out without pain is quick suicide
All live in hell and fear
It's your fate, it's better to die
