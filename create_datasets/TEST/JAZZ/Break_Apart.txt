It's hard to take all of this hate
It's hard to take all of this hate, ooh, this hate

First move they think they never saw
Be careful with me, be careful with
Join with me

I should've heard your fear
So, it's on me, so, it's on
I should've heard your needs
So, it's on, so, it's on, so, it's on

We've thrown apart these pieces
We've thrown apart these pieces
So, I don't go home
Tell me love, tell me love

You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
You're my

Instead of something to break apart
Instead, it's just broke apart
Stand up and shake this heart
Instead, it's just a break apart from us

I should've heard your needs
Shame on me

Help me out on me, help me out on me
Help me out on me, help me out on me
Help me out on me, help me out
