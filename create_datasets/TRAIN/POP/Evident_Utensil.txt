Verse 1
The most evident utensil,
Is non other then a pencil,
Not a multi-colored stencil,
Or a camera and cool.

How hard must I try,
How hard must I try for you,
You see me rolling in the dark,
You see me crawling up the walls for you.

Verse2
The most evident utensil,
Is non other then a pencil,
Right and tell me what you want from me,
Before my paper is through.

How hard must I try,
How hard must I try for you,
You see me rolling in the dark,
You see me crawling up the walls for you.
How hard must I try,
How hard must I try for you,
You see me rolling in the dark,
You see me crawling up the walls for you.
