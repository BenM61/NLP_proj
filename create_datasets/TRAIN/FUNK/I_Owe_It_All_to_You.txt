Smile you see is just a frown
But you can't tell 'cause it's upside down
I play the part of a carefree girl
Never fly for the only one

But take control to live
And I'm sure that you see
Heartache's, my darling
Written all over me

And I owe it all to you
Your all across my loneliness
I owe it all to you
For the heartaches that I posses

Yeah, this lonely Mrs Keep Me in mind
Don't know how poor heartache's about
All things are hard to solve
Just sit back and watch your love gone wrong

My life will never be the same
And oh, my darling, you're to blame

And I owe it all to you
Your all across my loneliness
I owe it all to you
For the heartaches that I posses

Yeah

Smile you see is just a frown
But you can't tell 'cause it's upside down
I play the part of a carefree girl
You're a part of a lonely world

But you take control
So now until you see
Heartache's, my darling
Written all over me

And I owe it all to you
Your all across my loneliness
I owe it all to you
For the heartaches that I posses

Yeah
Oh, yeah
