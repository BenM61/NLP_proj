Even though Jeff was worried
They weren't in a hurry
They planned a lovely honeymoon
Sue had a brand new Chevy
Conservative, in good taste

Only 30 payments due
They had outstanding tickets
They had no car insurance
But they had lots of things to do

They were getting organized
They had their plans all finalized
The date was set for Saturday
Susie and Jeffrey, they're gonna get married
They're going for a blood test

What if I don't pass my blood test?
What about our marriage licence?
What if I can't be deprogrammed?

Don't act like it's your last chance
We could have fun at the Spahn Ranch
It's not like Gordon Avenue
Susie and Jeffey, they're gonna get married
They're going for a blood test

Jeffrey said, "Let's wait"
Sue took her foot off the brake
He drove into a wall
Don't get excited, now don't shout
I'll scratch your eyes out
Now we can't have our honeymoon

Don't touch she's my fiance
Say, but I like the way you play
An autograph from Orson Welles
I'm a fan, here's my record
(It's one we can't get programmed)
We want to give to all of you

They had a little argument
Sue took her foot off the brake
He drove the car into a wall
They had a little argument
Sue took her foot off the brake

He drove the car into a wall
They had a disagreement
Sue took her foot off the brake
He drove the car into a wall
