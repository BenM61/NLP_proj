Oh way too talk game, it's so tough
Damn I love it all
Even the way you flex
That's what turn me on
Ooh you know you make me weak
Just 'cause the way you are
'Cause everybody in it know you're a star
But still I'm letting you know
I got the sweetest heart
Any man that wants it babe
He gon' have to work hard
From what I see, you got what I want
That's just half the part
Gotta see what you put on it
To make sure you're the one

If you put it down right like the way I want it
Play your cards right, maybe we can fall in love
If you put it, put it, if you put it down
If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love

I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
I'mma put it down, you can fall in love

If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love

I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
I'mma put it down, you can fall in love

If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love

I hope the chivalry ain't dead to you boy cause I'm grown
Gotta pull up, and then come up with that when I see what I want
Gotta go old school women sometimes
Still keep it soul, twenty twelve for me
But I still beef it up
And that I still I want you to know
Got the sweetest heart
And even though he can ride it cool for me
He gon' have to work hard
And now I see, you got what I want
That's just half the part
I gotta feel what you put on it
To make sure you're the one

If you put it down right like the way I want it
Play your cards right, maybe we can fall in love
If you put it, put it, if you put it down
If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love

I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
I'mma put it down, you can fall in love

If you put it down right, maybe we can fall in love

I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
I'mma put it down, you can fall in love

Ain't nobody put it down like me though
Why are you playing? girl you know
With all this money, and all your cake
Girl you better stop, I got a big ego
I'm sipping on that brandy
That liquor comes in handy
And girl I know you fancy
But this party I'm financing
It's so me, it ain't even like that
The way you hating all night
A friend uptight, all right
(So put it down)
I took her at the club
Told the girl she'd be right back
Back to the crib
And in the morning all this is worth it
Baby go get your hair did
And buy you a couple purses

You, you, you, can be the one I go
When having a bad day
And I need a shoulder to cry
You, you, you, might change the way I feel
Teach me how to let the guard down
Ain't gone lie, there's been times
Thought the one I had
Was the answer to my prayers
Come to find out and he wasn't the truth
And I got you, tryna tell me
If I let you put it down

I'mma put it down, you can fall in love

If you put it down right like the way I want it
Play it 'cause we, maybe we can fall in love
If you put it, put it, put it, if you put it, put it
If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love

I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
I'mma put it down, you can fall in love

If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love

I'mma put it down, you can fall in love
I'mma put it down, you can fall in love

If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love

If you put it down right like the way I want it

If you put it, put it, put it, if you put it, put it down
If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love
