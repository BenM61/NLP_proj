Mary had a little lamb
His fleece was white as snow, yeah
And everywhere the child went
That little lamb was sure to go now

He followed her to school one day
Which broke the teachers cool
But what a time did they have
That day at school

Tisket! Tasket! baby
A green and yellow basket
I sent a letter to my baby
And on my way I past it
