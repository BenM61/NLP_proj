I cry, I cry
I cry, I cry

So hard to think about what we could have been
Where love coulda taken us
Blame it on the wind and cry, cry, cry

You know why (you know why)
I'm drowning in an ocean of saltwater
I couldn't make it any more harder

That's why I cry, I cry
I cry, I cry every night
I cry, I cry
I cry, I cry every night

Hate that he looks at you the way that I still do
I get so emotional, can't we make a truce?
'Cause I cry, cry

You know why (you know why)
I'm drowning in a ocean of saltwater
I couldn't make it any more harder

That's why I cry, I cry
I cry, I cry every night
I cry, I cry
I cry

(I cry) since you've been away
Nothing's the same, no more
(I cry) and I'll be okay
If you make your way
My front door

I cry

Come back to me, yeah
Come back to me, yeah
Come back to me, yeah
Come back
Come back, would you come back to me, yeah?
Come back to me, yeah
Come back to me, yeah
When you're gone

That's why I cry, I cry
I cry, I cry every night
I cry, I cry
I cry

(I cry) since you've been away
Nothing's the same, no more
(I cry) and I'll be okay
If you make your way
My front door

I cry
