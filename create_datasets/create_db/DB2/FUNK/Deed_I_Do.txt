I was oh, so blue till you came along
Just to make my life a wonderful song
You brought sunshine just to brighten my loneliness
Is it any wonder in my happiness
I confess

Do I want you
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do
Do I need you?
Oh my, do I
Honey, 'deed I do

I'm glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hangin' 'round you
Do I love you?
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do

There are lots of others that I have met
Those you meet today, tomorrow forget
You're the only one who ever could stand the test
That's the reason why I choose you from the rest
You're the best

Do I want you
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do
Do I need you?
Oh my, do I
Honey, 'deed I do
